It's not what you think. \n\n  \n\nPlenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.\n\nDavid Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.\n\nProvocative, rigorous, and engrossing, Range makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.\n  ...more"

Changes in distribution were at least as important as changes in production, as the authors demonstrate in this unique account of the rise of modern marketing. Their focus is on iron, tobacco, railway supplies, and perishable goods, and they show how rising industrial capacity, the concentration of markets, and advancing technology forced new methods of distribution and the decline of independent merchants and wholesalers. By the beginning of the 20th century the outlines of a new economic order had emerged, one in which the modern corporation became the dominant institution. \"A splendid study in business history.

Just as ancient Greeks celebrated Elysium, much-cherished heaven of heroes, and the Bible speaks of the Promised Land, ultimate destination of faithful, Management Science is goal-oriented, obsessed with vision, mission, objectives, milestones, and targets.\n\nBy contrast, Business Sutra is gaze-oriented.

But in a global village, where everything is volatile and vibrant, there is need for a theory that is more comfortable with infinity, diversity, uncertainty and non-linear modes of thinking.

Pindar’s friends share with Joe the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success and teach him how to open himself up to the power of giving. \n\nJoe learns that changing his focus from getting to giving—putting others’ interests first and continually adding value to their lives—ultimately leads to unexpected returns. \n\nImparted with wit and grace, The Go-Giver is a heartwarming and inspiring tale that brings new relevance to the old proverb “Give and you shall receive.”\n  ...more"

The legendary Omaha investor has never written a memoir, but now he has allowed one writer, Alice Schroeder, unprecedented access to explore directly with him and with those closest to him his work, opinions, struggles, triumphs, follies, and wisdom. The result is the personally revealing and complete biography of the man known everywhere as “The Oracle of Omaha.”\n\nAlthough the media track him constantly, Buffett himself has never told his full life story. His reality is private, especially by celebrity standards. Indeed, while the homespun persona that the public sees is true as far as it goes, it goes only so far. Warren Buffett is an array of paradoxes. He set out to prove that nice guys can finish first. Over the years he treated his investors as partners, acted as their steward, and championed honesty as an investor, CEO, board member, essayist, and speaker. At the same time he became the world’s richest man, all from the modest Omaha headquarters of his company Berkshire Hathaway. None of this fits the term “simple.”\n\nWhen Alice Schroeder met Warren Buffett she was an insurance industry analyst and a gifted writer known for her keen perception and business acumen. Her writings on finance impressed him, and as she came to know him she realized that while much had been written on the subject of his investing style, no one had moved beyond that to explore his larger philosophy, which is bound up in a complex personality and the details of his life. Out of this came his decision to cooperate with her on the book about himself that he would never write.\n\nNever before has Buffett spent countless hours responding to a writer’s questions, talking, giving complete access to his wife, children, friends, and business associates—opening his files, recalling his childhood. It was an act of courage, as The Snowball makes immensely clear. Being human, his own life, like most lives, has been a mix of strengths and frailties. Yet notable though his wealth may be, Buffett’s legacy will not be his ranking on the scorecard of wealth; it will be his principles and ideas that have enriched people’s lives. This book tells you why Warren Buffett is the most fascinating American success story of our time.\n  ...more"

Then meet James Hester.\nHe and his wife had $70 and a four-year-old Studebaker when they were married in 1955. By 1968 they had a better car, more than their fair share of personal belongings, and $14,000. Then their net worth increased to $300,000. The increase was more than his total salary. They did this while raising three sons and maintaining a comfortable standard of living.\nAmazing? It certainly is. Lucky? Not at all! James Hester followed a plan—and you can use it every bit as effectively as he did.\nOriginally published in 1979, The Penny Capitalist is now held in 236 libraries worldwide. Copies have been advertised on E-Bay for up to $900. \nWhy republish a 30-plus-year-old book? Markets fluctuate. Human nature hasn’t changed. The opportunities are still out there. Each generation has to learn it all over again. \nMarkets go up and markets go down. When they go down, the average investor panics and sells out at the bottom. When they go up, the average investor waits to see if the rally is real. By the time they decide to buy, the market is topping out. The savvy investor does just the opposite. As Warren Buffett has said, “When people get fearful, I get greedy. When people get greedy, I get fearful.”\n\n\nAbout The Author:\nJames Hester (aka Algernon Horatio) has been a full professor and research scientist at a large mid-western state university. He is the author of a textbook and numerous scientific articles and monographs. He has served in research and administrative capacities with several federal and state agencies and a state museum. His career as a Penny Capitalist did not result from any grand design but from the imaginative pursuit of offbeat opportunities, or, as he puts it, “the only alternatives open to me.”\n  ...more"

Porter's Competitive Advantage explores the underpinnings of competitive advantage in the individual firm.\n\nCompetitive Advantage introduces a whole new way of understanding what a firm does. Porter's groundbreaking concept of the value chain disaggregates a company into \"activities,\" or the discrete functions or processes that represent the elemental building blocks of competitive advantage.\n\n Now an essential part of international business thinking, Competitive Advantage takes strategy from broad vision to an internally consistent configuration of activities. Its powerful framework provides the tools to understand the drivers of cost and a company's relative cost position. Porter's value chain enables managers to isolate the underlying sources of buyer value that will command a premium price, and the reasons why one product or service substitutes for another. He shows how competitive advantage lies not only in activities themselves but in the way activities relate to each other, to supplier activities, and to customer activities. Competitive Advantage also provides for the first time the tools to strategically segment an industry and rigorously assess the competitive logic of diversification.\n\n That the phrases \"competitive advantage\" and \"sustainable competitive advantage\" have become commonplace is testimony to the power of Porter's ideas. Competitive Advantage has guided countless companies, business school students, and scholars in understanding the roots of competition. Porter's work captures the extraordinary complexity of competition in a way that makes strategy both concrete and actionable.\n  ...more"

Working at different firms, they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another, the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency trading—source of the most intractable problems—will have no advantage whatsoever.\n\nThe characters in Flash Boys are fabulous, each completely different from what you think of when you think “Wall Street guy.” Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the world’s stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits.\n\nThe light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the financial world may not be good for your blood pressure, because if you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in the end, Flash Boys is an uplifting read. Here are people who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment where you don’t get paid for that; they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to fix it.\n  ...more"

As Senge makes clear, in the long run the only sustainable competitive advantage is your organization’s ability to learn faster than the competition. The leadership stories in the book demonstrate the many ways that the core ideas in The Fifth Discipline, many of which seemed radical when first published in 1990, have become deeply integrated into people’s ways of seeing the world and their managerial practices. \n\nIn The Fifth Discipline, Senge describes how companies can rid themselves of the learning “disabilities” that threaten their productivity and success by adopting the strategies of learning organizations—ones in which new and expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, collective aspiration is set free, and people are continually learning how to create results they truly desire. \n\nThe updated and revised Currency edition of this business classic contains over one hundred pages of new material based on interviews with dozens of practitioners at companies like BP, Unilever, Intel, Ford, HP, Saudi Aramco, and organizations like Roca, Oxfam, and The World Bank. It features a new Foreword about the success Peter Senge has achieved with learning organizations since the book’s inception, as well as new chapters on Impetus (getting started), Strategies, Leaders’ New Work, Systems Citizens, and Frontiers for the Future. \n\nMastering the disciplines Senge outlines in the book will:\n\n• Reignite the spark of genuine learning driven by people focused on what truly matters to them\n• Bridge teamwork into macro-creativity\n• Free you of confining assumptions and mindsets\n• Teach you to see the forest and the trees\n• End the struggle between work and personal time\n  ...more"

And in Creating Magic, he shares the leadership principles that not only guided his own journey from a poor farm boy in Oklahoma to the head of operations for a multibillion dollar enterprise, but that also soon came to form the cultural bedrock of the world's number one vacation destination. But as Lee demonstrates, great leadership isn't about mastering impossibly complex management theories. We can all become outstanding leaders by following the ten practical, common sense strategies outlined in this remarkable book. As straightforward as they are profound, these leadership lessons include: \nEveryone is important.\nMake your people your brand. \nBurn the free fuel: appreciation, recognition, and encouragement. \nGive people a purpose, not just a job. \nCombining surprising business wisdom with insightful and entertaining stories from Lee's four decades on the front lines of some of the world's best-run companies, Creating Magic shows all of us - from small business owners to managers at every level - how to become better leaders by infusing quality, character, courage, enthusiasm, and integrity into our workplace and into our lives.\n  ...more"

Featuring lessons learned from successful businesses in the world's poorest countries, Jessica Jackley's Clay Water Brick will motivate readers to more deeply appreciate the incredible entrepreneurial potential that exists in every human being on this planet--especially themselves.\n\n\"The heart of entrepreneurship is never about what we have. It's about what we do.\"\n  \n Meet Patrick, who had next to nothing and started a thriving business using just the ground beneath his feet . . .\n\nBlessing, who built her shop right in the middle of the road, refusing to take the chance that her customers might pass her by . . .\n\nConstance, who cornered the banana market in her African village with her big personality and sense of mission.\n\nPatrick, Blessing, Constance, and many others are among the poorest of the world's poor. And yet they each had crucial lessons to teach Jessica Jackley--lessons about resilience, creativity, perseverance, and, above all, entrepreneurship.\n\nFor as long as she could remember, Jackley, the co-founder of the revolutionary microlending site Kiva, had a singular and urgent ambition: to help alleviate global poverty. While in her twenties, she set off for Africa to finally meet the people she had long dreamed of helping. The insights of those she met changed her understanding. Today she believes that many of the most inspiring entrepreneurs in the world are not focused on high-tech ventures or making a lot of money; instead, they wake up every day and build better lives for themselves, their families, and their communities, regardless of the things they lack or the obstacles they encounter. As Jackley puts it, \"The greatest entrepreneurs succeed not because of what they possess but because of what they are determined to do.\"\n\nIn Clay Water Brick,  Jackley challenges readers to embrace entrepreneurship as a powerful force for change in the world. She shares her own story of founding Kiva with little more than a laptop and a dream, and the stories and the lessons she has learned from those across the globe who are doing the most with the least.\n\nPraise for Clay Water Brick\n  \n \"Jessica Jackley didn't wait for permission to change the world--she just did it. It turns out that you can too.\"--Seth Godin, author of What to Do When It's Your Turn\n \n   \n\n\"Fascinating . . . gripping . . . bursting with lessons . . . Jessica Jackley has written a remarkable book . . . so thoroughly well meaning and engagingly put it is too magnetic to put down.\"--Financial Times\n\n\"Clay Water Brick is a tremendously inspiring read. Jessica Jackley, the virtuoso co-founder of the revolutionary microlending platform Kiva, shares uplifting stories and compelling lessons on entrepreneurship, resilience, and character.\"--Adam Grant, author of Give and Take\n\n\"A blueprint for anyone who wants to make the world a better place and find fulfillment in the process, no matter how scarce their resources or how steep the challenge.\"--Arianna Huffington\n\n\"This book is inspirational. And honest and practical. . . . Well written, thoughtful: a selfless account of how to succeed by doing right and following your heart.\"--Booklist\n  ...more"

This book shows you how.Oliver spent seven years in the corporate 9-5 grind, slowly accumulating cash-flowing real estate on the side. As his passive income grew, so too did his realization that there was another way to live. He quit his job, and start living by the rules that define the growing demographic of the “new rich”.He rejected the idea that you need to work a job you don’t like, and embrace the concept of Lifestyle Design. Now he works according to his lifestyle, not the other way around. He retired by the age of 30, which he’s proud to say is 17 years sooner than his mentor Robert Kiyosaki (Author of Rich Dad Poor Dad), and since has become an expert in real estate investing and business ownership. Quitting his job and rejecting the great American hoax has allowed Oliver to...  \n   Increase his real estate portfolio from one $30k townhouse to $15M in apartment buildings. \n   \n    Start and grow two multi-million dollar private label online companies.\n   \n   Improve his golf handicap from 26 to 10 in three months. \n   Maintain 9% body fat throughout the whole year. \n   \n    Travel the world for months at a time.\n   \n   Be Steadfast in his belief that any person can become world class (top 1%) in six months. \n  \n  So what are you waiting for?!\n  \n  Scroll up and Buy Now!\n \n  ...more"

From seemingly insignificant daily decisions to major life choices, you negotiate every time you aim to persuade, argue over a decision, or resolve a conflict. But as negotiations and leadership expert Erica Ariel Fox reveals, the most important negotiations-the ones that determine the impact of our actions and the quality of our lives-are those we have with ourselves.\n\nMost of us recognize the difference between our knowledge-what we know we should do and say-and our know-how-what we actually do and say in real life when it counts. Fox calls this the \"Performance Gap,\" and she shows you how to close it, turning breakdowns into breakthroughs, whether struggling with a difficult client, arguing with a combative teenager, or organizing for community action.\n\nWinning from Within combines insights from Western psychology and Eastern philosophy with practical applications from real business situations and everyday life. Fox shows that the ability to achieve mastery over how we interact with each other comes from within, from the \"center\" where desires, thoughts, feelings, and impulses to take action live side-by-side. Winning from Within offers a profound and highly practical seven-step method for making changes that last-at work and at home. As Erica Ariel Fox demonstrates, we can actually get what we want-and feel good about the result.\n  ...more"

It combines Deborah Rowland's own rigorous research into change and its leadership with insights from her extensive field experience helping major global corporations including GlaxoSmithKline, RWE and Shell achieve lasting change with increased productivity, employee engagement and responsible societal impact. It is filled with helpful inspiring stories of leadership and change from the real world and, bravely, the author's own personal journey.\n\nChallenging leaders to cultivate both their inner and outer skills necessary for success, Still Moving weaves together the \"being\" and \"doing\" of states of leading change and emphasises the importance of a mindful stance and deep systemic perception within a leader. With the goal of collaborative, sustainable change, the book delves into a variety of important topics, including present-moment awareness, intentional response, edge and tension and emergent change. Compelling and provocative, Still Moving questions the conventional wisdom of much change theory and asks that leaders first work on their inner source in order to more effortlessly change the world around them.\n  ...more"

It is one of the fastest growing companies in history, an essential part of the social life not only of teenagers but hundreds of millions of adults worldwide. As Facebook spreads around the globe, it creates surprising effects—even becoming instrumental in political protests from Colombia to Iran.\n\n Veteran technology reporter David Kirkpatrick had the full cooperation of Facebook’s key executives in researching this fascinating history of the company and its impact on our lives. Kirkpatrick tells us how Facebook was created, why it has flourished, and where it is going next. He chronicles its successes and missteps, and gives readers the most complete assessment anywhere of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the central figure in the company’s remarkable ascent. This is the Facebook story that can be found nowhere else.\n\n How did a nineteen-year-old Harvard student create a company that has transformed the Internet and how did he grow it to its current enormous size? Kirkpatrick shows how Zuckerberg steadfastly refused to compromise his vision, insistently focusing on growth over profits and preaching that Facebook must dominate (his word) communication on the Internet. In the process, he and a small group of key executives have created a company that has changed social life in the United States and elsewhere, a company that has become a ubiquitous presence in marketing, altering politics, business, and even our sense of our own identity. This is the Facebook Effect.\n  ...more"

His books, blog posts, magazine articles, and speeches have inspired countless entrepreneurs, marketing people, innovators, and managers around the world. Now, for the first time, Godin has collected the most provocative short pieces from his pioneering blog-ranked #70 by Feedster (out of millions published) in worldwide readership. This book also includes his most popular columns from Fast Company magazine, and several of the short e-books he has written in the last few years. A sample: * Bon Jovi And The Pirates * Christmas Card Spam * Clinging To Your Job Title? * How Much Would You Pay to Be on Oprah's Show? * The Persistence of Really Bad Ideas * The Seduction of \"Good Enough\" * What Happens When It's All on Tape? * Would You Buy Life Insurance at a Rock Concert? Small is the New Big is a huge bowl of inspiration that you can gobble in one sitting or dip into at any time. As Godin writes in his introduction: \"I guarantee that you'll find some ideas that don't work for you. But I'm certain that you're smart enough to see the stuff you've always wanted to do, buried deep inside one of these riffs. And I'm betting that once inspired, you'll actually make something happen.\" Editorial Reviews In what's likely to be the next in a string of bestselling marketing guides (after Purple Cow), Godin compiles entries from his popular blog. Many are only a few paragraphs long, though he also adds longer entries, from his Fast Company column, to the mix. The pieces are arranged alphabetically by title rather than chronologically, leading to occasional choppiness, but Godin's ability to hone in on key issues remains intact. Following up on the themes of his earlier books, he reminds readers that the first key to successful marketing is to produce something remarkable and let it grow. \"If your\n  ...more"

As his thesis he compiled his favorite inspirational stories that he'd been gathering for almost three years and turned them into a book. Packed with 120 short-stories from all around the world, and from many different decades, We All Need Heroes celebrates people with brave and innovative ideas. Simon believes that the stories will convert the skeptical into believers, make heroes out of cowards and turn dull entrepreneurs and directors into trendsetters.

Start that business you've dreamed about but never had the guts to turn into reality. There is simply no limit on what you will gain by reading We All Need Heroes.

These projects and people have encouraged me to follow my crazy dreams and pursue my chosen career. I give examples of possible moral, lessons to be learned from each story, but of course they're free for you to interpret. I truly hope that my chosen favorites will continue to inspire others to dare take the step, and get the courage to do something different.

As long as men continue to make the rules and women continue to play by a male playbook, women will never succeed. The game is rigged against them. It’s time to change the rules of the game. In order to get ahead, women have to play by women’s rules capitalizing on women’s exceptional advantages in the modern business world by using an entirely different playbook—one written by a woman, for women. \n\n\nThis is that playbook.\n\n\nLinda provides women a full understanding of their superior emotional intelligence—the universally recognized marker for leadership success. She tackles an “eyes wide open” discussion of the need to slay the two ferocious dragons guarding the doors barring women from equality—the external dragon of male domination and the internal dragon of self-sabotage. She provides women with dragon slayers to defeat both dragons, and goes on to show women how to use the dragon slayers in the workplace. As part of the program, Linda tackles how to handle difficult men and shut down sexual harassment; how to infiltrate the old boys’ network and speak truth to power; how to establish dominance and lead with gusto and how to leave a legacy.\n\n\nIt’s time for women to use their unique feminine kick assets and unleash their power!\n  ...more"

Dr. Jeffrey Liker, a renowned authority on Toyota's Lean methods, explains how you can adopt these principles--known as the \"Toyota Production System\" or \"Lean Production\"--to improve the speed of your business processes, improve product and service quality, and cut costs, no matter what your industry.\n\nDrawing on his extensive research on Toyota, Dr. Liker shares his insights into the foundational principles at work in the Toyota culture. He explains how the Toyota Production System evolved as a new paradigm of manufacturing excellence, transforming businesses across industries.

And we promise, you won’t like the tagline.”\n\nA few years back, a shocking best seller called Why Johnny Can’t Read woke up the education establishment and revived the lost art of phonics. Now, Why Johnny Can’t Brand blows the lid off the marketing establishment by reviving the lost art of the Big Idea.\n\nAccording to Bill Schley and Carl Nichols, Jr., modern branding is a daily choice between real, muscle-building ideas and an immense smorgasbord of empty-caloried junk. The stakes are huge, especially in a world with 155 kinds of shampoo. So why do so many good companies choose wrong? In fact, why do most fail to differentiate at all—handing what some call an “unfair” advantage to the few who do? The surprising answers, and the exclusive, eight-week prescription to fix it, are here in Why Johnny Can’t Brand. \n\nSchley and Nichols—who have more than twenty-five years of experience working with global giants as well as small, spunky, start-ups—present an in-your-face, no-nonsense guide to what real branding and communicating is all about.\n\nThe secret is uncovering and focusing on the Dominant Selling Idea—the one unifying idea at the center of every brand—before you charge ahead with advertising or anything else. The Dominant Selling Idea (DSI) is “the thing you do that’s superlative, important and believable, made memorable and tangible—the difference that makes people want to buy you.” It automatically puts you in a category of one. \n\nIn the often funny, page-turning style of two award-winning, former Madison Avenue communicators, Schley and Nichols explain:\n1.Why real branding is the opposite of what you think\n2. How positioning turns your brand asset from fool’s gold to real gold \n3. Why Harvard and Stanford MBAs are the last to get it (but fear not—they can learn this too)\n4. How to find your Big Idea in about eight weeks—then keep it...\nand so much more. \n\nWhy Johnny Can’t Brand clears away the morass we thought was branding, just when we need it most. In a world with 300 million messages whizzing by every second, it gives us the ultimate ad- vantage—an inspiring, power-packed return to the secret of the idea centered brand.\n\n—From the cover of the first edition\n\n  ...more"

Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us \"predictably\" irrational.\n\nFrom drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. \"Predictably Irrational\" will change the way we interact with the world--one small decision at a time.\n  ...more"

The book's timeless advice - to make work pay not just in cash, but in experience, satisfaction, and joy - will be embraced by anyone who wants success to come, not just from what they do, but from who they are. At once a fictional tale of Komisar's encounters with a would-be entrepreneur, and a personal account of how Komisar found meaning not in work's rewards but in work itself, the book illustrates what's wrong with the mainstream thinking that we should sacrifice our lives to make a living. Described by Fortune.com as \"part personal essay, part fictional narrative, and part meditation on the nature of work and life,\" The Monk and the Riddle is essential reading on the art of creating a life while making a living.\n  ...more"

In the end, the Positive No will help you get not just to any Yes but to the right Yes, the one that truly serves your interests. \n\nBased on William Ury’s celebrated Harvard University course for managers and professionals, The Power of a Positive No offers concrete advice and practical examples for saying No in virtually any situation.

The decentralization of power away from closed systems and organizations, including Silicon Valley itself, distributing innovation to new technology hubs around the globe.\n\n- The Four Cs. Communication, content, community, and commerce—the activities and commercial applications of the more than six billion mobile internet users—restructuring every market and remaking every business.\n\n- The first in-depth analysis of the IPO debacle by Facebook and other mispriced firms and what these incidents say about the lack of understanding of value in this new and uncertain market space.\n\n- The Mobile Internet Genome. A lingua franca, a technology classification system, and the analytical tool that innovators and investors need in order to understand, value and manage this new class of strategic asset.\n\n- Mobile Presence. A quality, not a technology; the principal monetization mechanism for the mobile internet, a form of ‘always-on’ autonomous search, intelligently managing the flow of our communications, content, and commercial transactions.\n\nThe mobile internet is going to change more lives, create more wealth, destroy more businesses, and upend more political systems than any force in history.

How can you nurture customers so that they are ready for your products and services? How will you deliver new value that a customer is not aware of, and how do you support them in their decision-making? These are some of the concepts covered in this book. The approaches have been shared in fictional short story form and summarised through a section entitled Insight at the end of each story. The stories discuss three different dimensions that need to be addressed to transform any organisation’s sales: transformation of attitude and approach to the customer, transformation of engagement with the customer, and transformation of the management of the sales process. \n  ...more"

How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? \n\nFace it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. \n\nCows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. \n\nIn Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place. \n\nDescription from Amazon.com\n  ...more"

Selling more than one million copies through five editions, it has provided generations of investors with the timeless value investing philosophy and techniques of Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd.\n\nAs relevant today as when they first appeared nearly 75 years ago, the teachings of Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, have withstood the test of time across a wide diversity of market conditions, countries, and asset classes.\n\nThis new sixth edition, based on the classic 1940 version, is enhanced with 200 additional pages of commentary from some of today s leading Wall Street money managers. These masters of value investing explain why the principles and techniques of Graham and Dodd are still highly relevant even in today s vastly different markets. The contributor list includes: Seth A. Klarman, president of The Baupost Group, L.L.C. and author of \"Margin of Safety\" James Grant, founder of \"Grant's Interest Rate Observer,\" general partner of Nippon Partners Jeffrey M. Laderman, twenty-five year veteran of \"BusinessWeek\" Roger Lowenstein, author of \"Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist\" and \"When America Aged\" and Outside Director, Sequoia Fund Howard S.

According to bestselling author Seth Godin, all these tactics are like the toppings at an ice cream parlor. If you start with ice cream, adding cherries and hot fudge and whipped cream will make it taste great. But if you start with a bowl of meatballs . . . yuck!\n\nAs traditional marketing fades away, the new tools seem irresistible. But they don't work as well for boring brands (meatballs) that might still be profitable but don't attract word of mouth, such as Cheerios, Ford trucks, Barbie dolls, or Budweiser. When Anheuser-Busch spends $40 million on an online network called BudTV, that's a meatball sundae. It leads to no new Bud drinkers, just a bad case of indigestion.\n\nMeatball Sundae is the definitive guide to the fourteen trends no marketer can afford to ignore. It explains what to do about the increasing power of stories, not facts; about shorter and shorter attention spans; and about the new math that says five thousand people who want to hear your message are more valuable than five million who don't. The winners aren't just annoying start-ups run by three teenagers who never had a real job. You'll also meet older companies that have adapted brilliantly, such as Blendtec, a thirty-year-old blender maker. It now produces Will it blend? videos that demolish golf balls, Coke cans, iPhones, and much more. For a few hundred dollars, Blendtec reached more than ten million eager viewers on YouTube.\n\nGodin doesn't pretend that it's easy to get your products, marketing messages, and internal systems in sync.

Popular axioms like these drive business decisions every day. Yet too much common management “wisdom” isn’t wise at all—but, instead, flawed knowledge based on “best practices” that are actually poor, incomplete, or outright obsolete. Worse, legions of managers use this dubious knowledge to make decisions that are hazardous to organizational health.\n\nJeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton show how companies can bolster performance and trump the competition through evidence-based management, an approach to decision-making and action that is driven by hard facts rather than half-truths or hype. This book guides managers in using this approach to dismantle six widely held—but ultimately flawed—management beliefs in core areas including leadership, strategy, change, talent, financial incentives, and work-life balance. The authors show managers how to find and apply the best practices for their companies, rather than blindly copy what seems to have worked elsewhere.\n\nThis practical and candid book challenges leaders to commit to evidence-based management as a way of organizational life—and shows how to finally turn this common sense into common practice.\n\n  ...more"

Drawing on confidential internal memos and interviews with dozens of key players, Lowenstein explains not just how the fund made and lost its money but also how the personalities of Long-Term’s partners, the arrogance of their mathematical certainties, and the culture of Wall Street itself contributed to both their rise and their fall.\n\nWhen it was founded in 1993, Long-Term was hailed as the most impressive hedge fund in history. But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-Term’s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCM’s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instability—and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.\n  ...more"

Dylan Thrasher follows up his 2013 best-selling release The Masculine Way: What Your Dream Girl Really Wants with a unique, highly anticipated book focusing on equal parts former (women, dating, love, relationships), equal parts latter (personal finance, careers, saving, retirement). \n \nA philosophy book standing out in the world of dating/relationship and financial advice, it offers insights on more than just “how to pick up chicks” or “how to get rich” type of material typically found, with chapters highlighting: \n \n-The role of family and friends in an Alpha Male’s life. \n-When marriage is appropriate, and thoughts on divorce. \n-The bachelorhood vs. commitment debate. \n-Education costs and their return on investment. \n-Saving and investing vs. spending and living. \n-Managing credit and debt. \n-Having a job vs. building a career. \n-What is the “game,” does it need to be played, and what is winning? \n-How to have beautiful women in your life (hint- it’s not based on being tall, rich or handsome) \n-The traditional male vs. female dynamics vs. today’s changing roles \n-When is cheating / infidelity ever ok? \n-Does money buy happiness or not? \n-Why spending money on women is unnecessary. \n-How much should one spend on cars or homes? \n-Things you can do today to make yourself more valued in the workplace \n-How to survive and remain valuable in a changing world, with changing economies. \n \nWith a goal to have every reader find more success in their life in all realms, from being a leader of men with financial freedom to creating attraction in only the most amazing woman/women you choose to have in your life, you will live the life you want confidently as you see the path in front of you. Always partial to living the life of a “natural” Alpha Male, the author focuses on step-by-step improvements in both realms as you use the power of self-discipline and focus to achieve everything from a better sex life to improved money management. Success is a holistic, total picture world – having either financial success or romantic success alone is not enough for a true Alpha Male. \n \nVery rarely will you see a book combining material on financial freedom with attracting women, discussing charisma and emotional control with pinpoint focus on self-improvement and motivation to live one’s dreams in establishing the relationships they truly want. As an empowered Alpha Male, this could be a wife/marriage or a bachelor lifestyle of many women in their lives, all of whom would be happy to be there! \n \nMore of a book promoting personal transformation, examining men's gender studies/men’s movements through a look at the “Manosphere” (collection of similar and varying philosophies in the seduction, pickup artist, and Red Pill communities), the book focuses on growth for more fulfilling interpersonal relationships of all kind, rather than simply examining dating & relationships. This book is ideal for those who want to cut a little deeper into social psychology with the author’s trademark incorrigible humor and tough love style mixed in. Written for both the up-and-coming Alpha Male and the older soul who wants to affirm the wisdom he has to share, this book is geared to help you truly develop a masculine mindset. \n\n  ...more"

We believe that wine tastes better in a $20 glass than a $1 glass. We believe that an $80,000 Porsche Cayenne is vastly superior to a $36,000 VW Touareg, which is virtually the same car. We believe that $225 Pumas will make our feet feel better-and look cooler-than $20 no-names . . . and believing it makes it true.  Successful marketers don't talk about features or even benefits. Instead, they tell a story. A story we want to believe.  This is a book about doing what consumers demand-painting vivid pictures that they choose to believe. Every organization-from nonprofits to car companies, from political campaigns to wineglass blowers-must understand that the rules have changed (again). In an economy where the richest have an infinite number of choices (and no time to make them), every organization is a marketer and all marketing is about telling stories.  Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview, a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner or the iPod.  But beware: If your stories are inauthentic, you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous, when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. That's a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers and Marlboro.  This is a powerful book for anyone who wants to create things people truly want as opposed to commodities that people merely need.\n  ...more"

Do you ever wonder how other people really see you? Though we are usually confident that we do, we are wrong more often than we think. And if we could see ourselves through others eyes, we might be really surprised. \n Yet regardless of our line of work or stage of life, success depends on understanding who we are and how we come across. Research shows that self-awareness means better work performance, smarter life choices, deeper, more meaningful relationships, and a more fulfilling career. There s just one problem: people can be remarkably poor judges of their behavior, performance, and impact on others. And despite the lip service given today to feedback, in the business world and beyond, it s rare to get candid, objective data on what we re doing well, and where we could stand to improve. \nOf course, at work and in life, we ve all come across people with a stunning lack of self-awareness but how often do we consider whether we might have the same problem? And if we did, how would we even know it? \nDrawing on her three-year, first-of-its-kind study of people who have dramatically improved their self-awareness, organizational psychologist Tasha Eurich reveals why we don t know ourselves as well as we think and what to do about it. Alongside her research, she integrates hundreds of academic studies and her 15 years of work with Fortune 500 clients, challenging conventional wisdom to reveal many surprising truths like why introspection is the enemy of insight, how experience isn t a bullet train to self-knowledge, and just how far others will go to avoid telling us the truth about ourselves. \nReaders will learn battle-tested techniques and tools to improve self-awareness and thus their work performance, leadership skills, interpersonal relationships, and more. Insight is a guide surviving and thriving in an unaware world.\"\n  ...more"

Drawing on exclusive access to J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and a tightly bonded team of bankers known on Wall Street as the \"Morgan Mafia,\" as well as in-depth interviews with dozens of other key players, including Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Tett brings to life in gripping detail how the Morgan team's bold ideas for a whole new kind of financial alchemy helped to ignite a revolution in banking, and how that revolution escalated wildly out of control. The deeply reported and lively narrative takes readers behind the scenes, to the inner sanctums of elite finance and to the secretive reaches of what came to be known as the \"shadow banking\" world. The story begins with the intense Morgan brainstorming session in 1994 beside a pool in Boca Raton, where the team cooked up a dazzling new idea for the exotic financial product known as credit derivatives. That idea would rip around the banking world, catapult Morgan to the top of the turbocharged derivatives trade, and fuel an extraordinary banking boom that seemed to have unleashed banks from ages-old constraints of risk. But when the Morgan team's derivatives dream collided with the housing boom, and was perverted -- through hubris, delusion, and sheer greed -- by titans of banking that included Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank, and the thundering herd at Merrill Lynch -- even as J.P. Morgan itself stayed well away from the risky concoctions others were peddling -- catastrophe followed. Tett's access to Dimon and the J.P. Morgan leaders who so skillfully steered their bank away from the wild excesses of others sheds invaluable light not only on the untold story of how they engineered their bank's escape from carnage but also on how possible it was for the larger banking world, regulators, and rating agencies to have spotted, and heeded, the terrible risks of a meltdown. A tale of blistering brilliance and willfully blind ambition, Fool's Gold is both a rare journey deep inside the arcane and wildly competitive world of high finance and a vital contribution to understanding how the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression was perpetrated. \n  \n\n\n  ...more"

The new findings: The best leaders were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid. Following the belief that leading in a \"fast world\" always requires \"fast decisions\" and \"fast action\" is a good way to get killed. The great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies.  This book is classic Collins: contrarian, data-driven, and uplifting.

Over the last two decades, we've watched the entire world change the way it buys and stays loyal to brands. But, marketing departments are still operating in the same, campaign-centric, product-led operation that they have been following for 75 years. The most innovative companies around the world have achieved remarkable marketing results by fundamentally changing their approach. By creating value for customers through the use of owned media and the savvy use of content, these businesses have dramatically increased customer loyalty and revenue. Some of them have even taken it to the next step and developed a marketing function that actually pays for itself.\n\nKilling Marketing explores how these companies are ending the marketing as we know it--in favor of this new, exciting model.\n\nKilling Marketing provides the insight, approaches, and examples you need to understand these disruptive forces in ways that turn your marketing from cost center to revenue creator. This book builds the case for, literally, transforming the purpose of marketing within your organization. Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose of the Content Marketing Institute show how leading companies are able sell the very content that propels their marketing strategy. You'll learn how to:\n\n* Transform all or part of your marketing operation into a media company\n\n* Integrate this new operation into traditional marketing efforts\n\n* Develop best practices for attracting and retaining audiences\n\n* Build a strategy for competing against traditional media companies\n\n* Create a paid/earned media strategy fueled by an owned media strategy\n\nRed Bull, Johnson & Johnson, Disney and Arrow Electronics have succeeded in what ten years ago would have been deemed impossible. They continue to market their products as they always have, and, through their content-driven and audience-building initiatives, they drive value outside the day-to-day products they sell--and monetize it directly.\n\nKilling Marketing rewrites the rules of marketing--enabling you to make the kind of transition that turns average companies into industry legends.\n\n\n\n  ...more"

But too often, even the most innovative organization quickly becomes a \"giant hairball\"--a tangled, impenetrable mass of rules, traditions, and systems, all based on what worked in the past--that exercises an inexorable pull into mediocrity. Gordon McKenzie worked at Hallmark Cards for thirty years, many of which he spent inspiring his colleagues to slip the bonds of Corporate Normalcy and rise to orbit--to a mode of dreaming, daring and doing above and beyond the rubber-stamp confines of the administrative mind-set. In his deeply funny book, exuberantly illustrated in full color, he shares the story of his own professional evolution, together with lessons on awakening and fostering creative genius.Originally self-published and already a business \"cult classic\", this personally empowering and entertaining look at the intersection between human creativity and the bottom line is now widely available to bookstores. It will be a must-read for any manager looking for new ways to invigorate employees, and any professional who wants to achieve his or her best, most self-expressive, most creative and fulfilling work.\n  ...more"

Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans.  Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, Moneyball is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (Liar's Poker, The New New Thing), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes Moneyball an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. --John Moe\n  ...more"

Fundamental problems, as Einstein once noted, cannot be solved at the same level of thought that created them. What we pay attention to, and how we pay attention - both individually and collectively - is key to what we create. What often prevents us from attending is what Scharmer calls our blind spot, the inner place from which each of us operates. Learning to become aware of our blind spot is critical to bringing forth the profound systemic changes so needed in business and society today. First introduced in Presence, the U methodology of leading profound change is expanded and deepened in Theory U. By moving through the \"U\" process we learn to connect to our essential Self in the realm of presencing - a term coined by Scharmer that combines the present with sensing. Here we are able to see our own blind spot and pay attention in a way that allows us to experience the opening of our minds, our hearts, and our wills. This wholistic opening constitutes a shift in awareness that allows us to learn from the future as it emerges, and to realize that future in the world. Theory U explores a new territory of scientific research and personal leadership, one that is grounded in real life experience and shared practices. Scharmer shares much from his own personal and professional development, and draws from a rich diversity of compelling stories and examples. Readers will find themselves drawn to new ways of thinking and acting as they read, completing a parallel journey of exploration and discovery. The final chapters lay out principles and practices that allow everyone to participate fully in co-creating and bringing forth the desired future that is working to emerge through us.\n  ...more"

The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.\n\nThe Challenge\nBuilt to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. \n\nBut what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? \n\nThe Study\nFor years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?\n\nThe Standards\nUsing tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. \n\nThe Comparisons\nThe research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? \n\nThe Findings\nThe findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:\nLevel 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.\n\nThe Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.\n\nA Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.\n\nThe Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.\n  ...more"

The more great people on your team, the more successful your organization will be. But that’s easier said than done. Statistically, half of all employment decisions result in a mishire: The wrong person winds up in the wrong job. But companies that have followed Bradford Smart’s advice in Topgrading have boosted their successful hiring rate to 90 percent or better, giving them an unbeatable competitive advantage. Now Smart has fully revised his 1999 management classic to reintroduce the topgrading concept, which works for companies large and small in any industry. The author spells out his practical approach to finding and managing A-level talentâ€”as well as coaching B players to turn them into A players. He provides intriguing case studies drawn from more than four thousand in-depth interviews. As Smart writes in his introduction, “All organizations, all businesses live or die mostly on their talent, and any manager who fails to topgrade is nuts, or a C player. . . . Those who, way deep down, would sooner see an organization die than nudge an incompetent person out of a job should not read this book...

This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.\n\nBut not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?\n\nThere are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.\n\nThe second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.\n\nThat is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.\n\nBut, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life\n  ...more"

How do we sustain momentum?\" They know that companies and organizations cannot thrive today without learning to adapt their attitudes and practices. But companies that establish change initiatives discover, after initial success, that even the most promising efforts to transform or revitalize organizations—despite interest, resources, and compelling business results—can fail to sustain themselves over time. That's because organizations have complex, well-developed immune systems, aimed at preserving the status quo.\n\nNow, drawing upon new theories about leadership and the long-term success of change initiatives, and based upon twenty-five years \nof experience building learning organizations, the authors of The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook show how to accelerate success and avoid the obstacles that can stall momentum. The Dance of Change, written for managers and executives at every level of an organization, reveals how business leaders can work together to anticipate the challenges that profound change will ultimately force the organization to face. Then, in a down-to-earth and compellingly clear format, readers will learn how to build the personal and organizational capabilities needed to meet those challenges.\n\nThese challenges are not imposed from the outside; they are the product of assumptions and practices that people take for granted—an inherent, natural part of the processes of change. And they can stop innovation cold, unless managers at all levels learn to anticipate them and recognize the hidden rewards in each challenge, and the potential to spur further growth. Within the frequently encountered challenge of \"Not Enough Time,\" for example—the lack of control over time available for innovation and learning initiatives—lies a valuable opportunity to reframe the way people organize their workplaces.\n\nThis book identifies universal challenges that organizations ultimately find themselves confronting, including the challenge of \"Fear and Anxiety\"; the need to diffuse learning across organizational boundaries; the ways in which assumptions built in to corporate measurement systems can handcuff learning initiatives; and the almost unavoidable misunderstandings between \"true believers\" and nonbelievers in a company.\n\nFilled with individual and team exercises, in-depth accounts of sustaining learning initiatives by managers and leaders in the field, and well-tested practical advice, The Dance of Change provides an insider's perspective on implementing learning and change initiatives at such corporations as British Petroleum, Chrysler, Dupont, Ford, General Electric, Harley-Davidson, Hewlett-Packard, Mitsubishi Electric, Royal DutchShell, Shell Oil Company, Toyota, the United States Army, and Xerox. It offers crucial advice for line-level managers, executive leaders, internal networkers, educators, and others who are struggling to put change initiatives into practice.\n  ...more"

Each year, millions of talented college students graduate with little or no real sense of what their next step will be, yet they are determined not to settle for a so-so career; they are looking for a great career. Smith points out that only a few fortunate souls are born knowing exactly what they want to pursue in life. The rest of us have to stop making excuses and start asking ourselves tough questions about achieving our goals.  In his straightforward, no-nonsense approach, Smith itemizes and dismisses all the usual excuses, fears, and worries that people hide behind when trying to find their true direction. His unusual take on this challenging conundrum is both universal and timely, and his stunning TEDx talk on this subject has been viewed by more than six million people so far.  This is the perfect book for any college graduate who is wondering where he or she fits into the world. It won't necessarily be easy, but if you follow Smith’s guidance, your career dreams can indeed come true. \n\n\n\n\n\n  ...more"

      "summary": "What needs of entrepreneurs are met by meeting the unmet needs of the customer? Do market conditions attract a person to take up entrepreneurship or is there a characteristic in us that attracts us to opportunities of a specific kind that is most likely to result in successful business ventures and aligned to who we are? Why do businesses exist? How to discover a customer'\n  What needs of entrepreneurs are met by meeting the unmet needs of the customer? Do market conditions attract a person to take up entrepreneurship or is there a characteristic in us that attracts us to opportunities of a specific kind that is most likely to result in successful business ventures and aligned to who we are? Why do businesses exist? How to discover a customer's met and unmet needs? What is the role of needs in building a nurturing and growth oriented work culture in an organization? What is its impact on the personal life of the entrepreneur? \n\nNeeds play an important role as a motivating force that enables people to move into action. It impacts many areas of entrepreneurship. This book is an attempt to provide perspectives on the impact of \"needs\" on various aspects of a business. \n\nThe journey to understanding customer needs starts by framing a complete needs statement (CNS) and a complete unmet needs statement (CUNS). A model has been provided to help the reader frame these two important statements. Together, the two of them can be a useful tool in the hands of anyone working with a customer. \nIn the chapter Customer Needs Discovery Process and Logical Levels the model is extended and linked to the “neurological levels” of Dr Robert Dilts. Dilts's logical levels have been used extensively to categorize the meaning of needs, consequences, customer profiling and decision making criteria. \n\nEmotional Intelligence (EI) has started to gain prominence in business organizations. The ABCDE model (Rational Emotive Behavioural Therapy) of Dr Albert Ellis is illustrated through examples. This model is useful in building EI in individuals and organizations. The disconnect between the desire for immediate action and the long term needs of an organization is analysed, and the application of the OFNR model (used in Non Violent Communication) is illustrated as well. \n\nThe chapter titled \"Perceived Reality, Innovation and New Ideas Generation\" has been dedicated to the need for innovation and new ideas generation. The chapter focuses on breakout innovation, its characteristics and the skills that one can develop to generate new ideas. Entrepreneurs often face the question, \"Do I want to be a pioneer or a follower?\" To bring clarity, I have analysed different decision making patterns that people employ in the chapter titled \"Entrepreneurial Dilemma: Pioneer or Follower\". \n\nGrowth, inclusiveness and the challenges of creating a motivated team are also explored in this chapter. The reader is introduced to the FROG model of motivation. This model highlights the role of catalysts in providing the momentum required to achieve one's goals. \nThe role of empathy in building a nurturing, compassionate organization is explored in the chapter titled \"Connectedness and Empathy\". How to connect to people, improve one's life and use language that is life enriching is illustrated using the model of Non-Violent Communication (NVC). \n\nThe book begins with the chapter \"Getting Started in Entrepreneurship\", which analyses the real reasons people are reluctant to taking up entrepreneurship. It also explores the attractiveness of the entrepreneurial journey, what you can learn from entrepreneurship, the brass tacks of starting a new venture, the desired characteristics of the startup team and the process of defining a mission and goals. \n\nWhen businesses fail, the usual focus is on various numerical analyses. Seldom is there any focus on the personal challenges that entrepreneurs face and how they cope with failures. The last chapter, \"Coping with Business Failures\", deals with exactly this. I have explored strategies at the level of beliefs, emotions and behaviour. \n\nI have illustrated many of the concepts using examples, real life excerpts and cartoons. Examples have been provided spanning the personal and professional life of an entrepreneur that highlights the application of the ideas to various contexts.\n  ...more"

But more than a temperament, being positive, we are told, is the key to success and prosperity. \n\nIn this utterly original take on the American frame of mind, Barbara Ehrenreich traces the strange career of our sunny outlook from its origins as a marginal nineteenth-century healing technique to its enshrinement as a dominant, almost mandatory, cultural attitude. Evangelical mega-churches preach the good news that you only have to want something to get it, because God wants to \"prosper\" you. The medical profession prescribes positive thinking for its presumed health benefits. Academia has made room for new departments of \"positive psychology\" and the \"science of happiness.\" Nowhere, though, has bright-siding taken firmer root than within the business community, where, as Ehrenreich shows, the refusal even to consider negative outcomes—like mortgage defaults—contributed directly to the current economic crisis.\n\nWith the myth-busting powers for which she is acclaimed, Ehrenreich exposes the downside of America’s penchant for positive thinking: On a personal level, it leads to self-blame and a morbid preoccupation with stamping out “negative” thoughts. On a national level, it’s brought us an era of irrational optimism resulting in disaster. This is Ehrenreich at her provocative best—poking holes in conventional wisdom and faux science, and ending with a call for existential clarity and courage.\n  ...more"

So how did he go from hapless office worker and serial failure to the creator of Dilbert, one of the world’s most famous syndicated comic strips, in just a few years? In How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big, Adams shares the strategy he has used since he was a teen to invite failure in, to embrace it, then pick its pocket. \n\nNo career guide can offer advice for success that works for everyone. As Adams explains, your best bet is to study the ways of others who made it big and try to glean some tricks and strategies that make sense for you. Adams pulls back the covers on his own unusual life and shares what he learned for turning one failure after another into something good and lasting. Adams reveals that he failed at just about everything he’s tried, including his corporate career, his inventions, his investments, and his two restaurants. But there’s a lot to learn from his personal story, and a lot of humor along the way. While it’s hard for anyone to recover from a personal or professional failure, Adams discovered some unlikely truths that helped to propel him forward. For instance:\n\n• Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners.\n• \"Passion\" is bull. What you need is personal energy.\n• A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable.\n• You can manage your odds in a way that makes you look lucky to others.\n  ...more"

Porter’s groundbreaking study of international competitiveness has shaped national policy in countries around the world. It has also transformed thinking and action in states, cities, companies, and even entire regions such as Central America.\n\nBased on research in ten leading trading nations, The Competitive Advantage of Nations offers the first theory of competitiveness based on the causes of the productivity with which companies compete. Porter shows how traditional comparative advantages such as natural resources and pools of labor have been superseded as sources of prosperity, and how broad macroeconomic accounts of competitiveness are insufficient. The book introduces Porter’s “diamond,” a whole new way to understand the competitive position of a nation (or other locations) in global competition that is now an integral part of international business thinking. Porter's concept of “clusters,” or groups of interconnected firms, suppliers, related industries, and institutions that arise in particular locations, has become a new way for companies and governments to think about economies, assess the competitive advantage of locations, and set public policy.\n \n Even before publication of the book, Porter’s theory had guided national reassessments in New Zealand and elsewhere. His ideas and personal involvement have shaped strategy in countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Portugal, Taiwan, Costa Rica, and India, and regions such as Massachusetts, California, and the Basque country. Hundreds of cluster initiatives have flourished throughout the world. In an era of intensifying global competition, this pathbreaking book on the new wealth of nations has become the standard by which all future work must be measured.\n  ...more"

Concerned that Starbucks had lost its way, Schultz was determined to help it return to its core values and restore not only its financial health, but also its soul. In Onward, he shares the remarkable story of his return and the company's ongoing transformation under his leadership, revealing how, during one of the most tumultuous economic times in history, Starbucks again achieved profitability and sustainability without sacrificing humanity. Offering readers a snapshot of a moment in history that left no company unscathed, the book zooms in to show, in riveting detail, how one company struggled and recreated itself in the midst of it all. The fastpaced narrative is driven by day-to-day tension as conflicts arise and lets readers into Schultz's psyche as he comes to terms with his limitations and evolving leadership style. Onward is a compelling, candid narrative documenting the maturing of a brand as well as a businessman.\n\nOnward represents Schultz's central leadership philosophy: It's not just about winning, but the right way to win. Ultimately, he gives readers what he strives to deliver every day - sense of hope that, no matter how tough times get, the future can be just as or more successful than the past, whatever one defines success to be.\n  ...more"

Christensen has been pessimistic about whether established companies can prevail in the face of disruption, but Charles A. O'Reilly III and Michael L. Tushman know they can! The authors explain how shrewd organizations have used an ambidextrous approach to solve their own innovator's dilemma. They contrast these luminaries with companies which--often trapped by their own successes--have been unable to adapt and grow.\n\nDrawing on a vast research program and over a decade of helping companies to innovate, the authors present a set of practices to guide firms as they adopt ambidexterity. Top-down and bottom-up leaders are key to this process--a fact too often overlooked in the heated debate about innovation. But not in this case. Readers will come away with a new understanding of how to improve their existing businesses through efficiency, control, and incremental change, while also seizing new markets where flexibility, autonomy, and experimentation rule the day.\n  ...more"

Coach Pitino was able to turn Louisville into NCAA champions by applying this idea to everything he and the team did—every practice, every recruiting visit, every game preparation, every scouting report, every instruction that he gave players and coaches, and everything he did himself. Each day became just as important as reaching the national championship, and so, by honoring the one-day contract, he and Louisville moved through adversity toward their goal.\n\nIn this inspiring and practical guide, Coach Rick Pitino illustrates how to set your own one-day contract, and follow through to honor it for each day, each goal, and each interaction with another person.

Or does he resole his shoes, turn off the air conditioning when he leaves the house, and spend a lot of time at home with close friends and family? Through his surveys of over 1,000 millionaires\n  The Barnes & Noble Review\n Who is the average millionaire? Does he eat gourmet or fast food? Does he drive fancy cars, take chic vacations, and indulge wherever and whenever he can? Or does he resole his shoes, turn off the air conditioning when he leaves the house, and spend a lot of time at home with close friends and family? Through his surveys of over 1,000 millionaires, Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D., answers these questions and provides us with further insight into the thoughts and lives of this wealthy segment of the population in The Millionaire Mind.  A follow-up to Stanley's New York Times bestseller, The Millionaire Next Door, The Millionaire Mind may surprise readers with its findings about the kinds of people that millionaires really are. Interestingly, many millionaires were not straight-A students in high school, nor did they attend prestigious colleges. Instead, they were often told when they were younger that they were not bright and that they would not be successful. These challenges taught them how to surmount obstacles and motivated them to try harder and to take risks to get ahead financially.  The major risks that these millionaires have taken and continue to take are financial ones. They must overcome the fear of taking risks, and they must maintain this courage throughout their adult careers. Stanley discovered that many millionaires share similarities in techniques to allay their anxieties and stay on track financially. Some of these include:   Believing in myself   Counting my blessings every day   Countering negativethoughtswith positive ones   Sharing concerns with spouse   Visualizing success   Outworking, outthinking, out-toughing the competition   Hiring talented advisors   Constantly upgrading my knowledge about my occupation   Spending considerable time planning my success   Exercising regularly   Having strong religious faith  Stanley also reveals that millionaires are very often successful in marriage as well as in work (the typical millionaire has been married to the same spouse for over twenty-five years) and that they usually lead relatively frugal, economically productive lifestyles. Perhaps most interesting to readers will be the section that Stanley devotes to how millionaires chose the career in which they would be most likely to succeed.  So don't miss out on picking apart and analyzing the thoughts and habits of millionaires with Thomas Stanley and The Millionaire Mind, a book sure to be as brilliantly revealing and fascinating as his previous bestseller on millionaires. Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D., is a researcher, author, and lecturer. He has studied the wealthy for more than 25 years. The Millionaire Next Door, published in 1996, has sold more than one million copies in hardcover and nearly one million in paperback. The book has been on The New York Times Best Sellers list for more than 150 combined weeks.  His previous books include Marketing to the Affluent, which Best of Business Quarterly named one of 10 outstanding business books, Selling to the Affluent, and Networking with the Affluent.  Dr. Stanley lives in Atlanta. He was a professor of marketing at Georgia State University, where he was named Omicron Delta Kappa Outstanding Professor. He holds his doctorate from the University of Georgia in Athens.  \n  ...more"

Such a book is “Flying with the Winged Elephant - Niche Opportunities for Global Businesses that May Emerge in India\".\n\nThe purpose behind this is to identify some of the niche opportunities that might emerge in an evolving and reviving India. For global businesses, the benefits might include increased demand for their specialized services, investments into high-growth pools of opportunity in India, demand for intellectual capital and manufactured inputs, ability to develop products more relevant for India’s cultural specificities, etc., and for India, the benefits might include business and income opportunities, creation of future assets to assist its growth story, deepening of domestic and export capabilities, and a fill-up to overall employment and entrepreneurship. \n\nSome of the opportunities mentioned are conventional ideas, but some might be unconventional, but not unreasonable. Many ideas relate to European and North American small businesses, but it is these very small businesses that can become large in a growth economy and help expand and diversify the corporate base. India’s journey following the 1990s reforms saw several such examples.\n\nIndia has often been characterized by the ‘Elephant’ vis-à-vis ‘Dragon’ for China. India’s evolving socio-economic profile, coupled with expectations of revival, can create niche opportunities for businesses worldwide. They can boost growth and help the elephant to race ahead, hence the usage of ‘Wings’. The usage of ‘Flying’ is to convey to global businesses that they could benefit from this growth, by actively partnering in these opportunities.\n\nTag: India, Opportunities, Business, Global, Money, Book, Finance, Modi, Investment, Investors, Growth, Stock Market\n  ...more"

Probably halfway around the world, to people and places that clean up what you don’t want and turn it into something you can’t wait to buy. In Junkyard Planet, Adam Minter—veteran journalist and son of an American junkyard owner—travels deeply into a vast, often hidden, multibillion-dollar industry that’s transforming our economy and environment.\n\nMinter takes us from back-alley Chinese computer recycling operations to high-tech facilities capable of processing a jumbo jet’s worth of recyclable trash every day. Along the way, we meet an unforgettable cast of characters who've figured out how to build fortunes from what we throw away: Leonard Fritz, a young boy \"grubbing\" in Detroit's city dumps in the 1930s; Johnson Zeng, a former plastics engineer roaming America in search of scrap; and Homer Lai, an unassuming barber turned scrap titan in Qingyuan, China. Junkyard Planet reveals how “going green” usually means making money—and why that’s often the most sustainable choice, even when the recycling methods aren’t pretty.\n\nWith unmatched access to and insight on the junk trade, and the explanatory gifts and an eye for detail worthy of a John McPhee or William Langewiesche, Minter traces the export of America’s recyclables and the massive profits that China and other rising nations earn from it. What emerges is an engaging, colorful, and sometimes troubling tale of consumption, innovation, and the ascent of a developing world that recognizes value where Americans don’t. Junkyard Planet reveals that we might need to learn a smarter way to take out the trash.\n  ...more"

Why do people so readily assume the worst about the motives of their fellow citizens? In The Righteous Mind, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt explores the origins of our divisions and points the way forward to mutual understanding. \n \nHis starting point is moral intuition—the nearly instantaneous perceptions we all have about other people and the things they do. These intuitions feel like self-evident truths, making us righteously certain that those who see things differently are wrong. Haidt shows us how these intuitions differ across cultures, including the cultures of the political left and right. He blends his own research findings with those of anthropologists, historians, and other psychologists to draw a map of the moral domain. He then examines the origins of morality, overturning the view that evolution made us fundamentally selfish creatures. But rather than arguing that we are innately altruistic, he makes a more subtle claim—that we are fundamentally groupish. It is our groupishness, he explains, that leads to our greatest joys, our religious divisions, and our political affiliations. In a stunning final chapter on ideology and civility, Haidt shows what each side is right about, and why we need the insights of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians to flourish as a nation.\n  ...more"

Knowing that responsibility for improving performance rested with him, he realized he had to improve his own leadership skills before he could improve his ship. Within months, he created a crew of confident and inspired problem-solvers eager to take the initiative and responsibility for their actions. The slogan on board became \"It's your ship,\" and Benfold was soon recognized far and wide as a model of naval efficiency. How did Abrashoff do it? Against the backdrop of today's United States Navy, Abrashoff shares his secrets of successful management including: \n\nSee the ship through the eyes of the crew: By soliciting a sailor's suggestions, Abrashoff drastically reduced tedious chores that provided little additional value.\nCommunicate, communicate, communicate: The more Abrashoff communicated the plan, the better the crew's performance. His crew eventually started calling him \"Megaphone Mike,\" since they heard from him so often.\nCreate discipline by focusing on purpose: Discipline skyrocketed when Abrashoff's crew believed that what they were doing was important.\nListen aggressively: After learning that many sailors wanted to use the GI Bill, Abrashoff brought a test official aboard the ship-and held the SATs forty miles off the Iraqi coast. From achieving amazing cost savings to winning the highest gunnery score in the Pacific Fleet, Captain Abrashoff's extraordinary campaign sent shock waves through the U.S. Navy. It can help you change the course of your ship, no matter where your business battles are fought.\n\n  ...more"

Can decline be detected early and avoided? How far can a company fall before the path toward doom becomes inevitable and unshakable? How can companies reverse course?\n\nIn How the Mighty Fall, Collins confronts these questions, offering leaders the well-founded hope that they can learn how to stave off decline and, if they find themselves falling, reverse their course. Collins' research project—more than four years in duration—uncovered five step-wise stages of decline:\n\nStage 1: Hubris Born of Success\n\nStage 2: Undisciplined Pursuit of More\n\nStage 3: Denial of Risk and Peril\n\nStage 4: Grasping for Salvation\n\nStage 5: Capitulation to Irrelevance or Death\n\nBy understanding these stages of decline, leaders can substantially reduce their chances of falling all the way to the bottom.\n\nGreat companies can stumble, badly, and recover.\n\nEvery institution, no matter how great, is vulnerable to decline. There is no law of nature that the most powerful will inevitably remain at the top. Anyone can fall and most eventually do. But, as Collins' research emphasizes, some companies do indeed recover—in some cases, coming back even stronger—even after having crashed into the depths of Stage 4.\n\nDecline, it turns out, is largely self-inflicted, and the path to recovery lies largely within our own hands. We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our history, or even our staggering defeats along the way. As long as we never get entirely knocked out of the game, hope always remains. The mighty can fall, but they can often rise again.\n  ...more"

Customers are more informed, aware of their choices and smarter about purchasing decisions. Companies that want to survive in this buyer-led digital age have to become much more customer focused or they will wither away. Author Carlos Hidalgo understands how companies need to change their marketing and sales functions to provide customers with information, service and relationship to make a smart purchasing choice. In Driving Demand Hidalgo provides a guidebook for companies that want to transform, but simply are perplexed by how to change. It is not enough to simply speak about 'change management' in an organization. Change management has to begin with a process that is first fully planned providing the details of how people, process, content, technology, and KPIs will be aligned throughout the organization to ensure a common demand generation approach that is federated across the organization. \n\nIn this book, Hidalgo provides a prescriptive roadmap that organizations can follow to ensure that the changes that are made become part of the DNA of their organization. This ensures that true transformation occurs—doing things differently instead of just doing different things. \n\nAs most B2B marketers lack the training and experience to adjust to the changing world around them and are either self-taught or learn as they go, this book highlights these features specifically for them: \n\n• A clear roadmap and framework on how B2B organizations can implement change management and transform their demand generation\n\n• Case studies and excerpts from B2B marketing practitioners and ANNUITAS clients who have transformed their organizations and how they accomplished this change\n\n• Current research from industry experts and thought leaders that demonstrates the need for this change \n\n• The potential pitfalls that can occur within an organization as a demand process is developed\n\n• Organizational models that should be implemented to ensure demand process is adopted throughout the enterprise\n\n  ...more"

What is less known is how their internal process develops their mindset to perform at the highest level. And it is much more than their ability to tolerate high risk or failure. The entrepreneur develops their personal mindset from an inner perspective, they trust that clarity will emerge from intuition to inform the initial idea or vision for a business.\n\nThis intuition is beyond the brain, it appears in the heart, gut and internal organs. We have a unique intuitive intelligence and you will learn just how entrepreneurs use this information to both attract and create a successful business.\n\nThis formula is the GPS for your entrepreneurial success. This formula has never been revealed outside the academic world. Through interviews with scientists, serial entrepreneurs and business thinkers about their individual experiences and with proven application and techniques, Jane Mara has unlocked the key to what makes serial entrepreneurs successful.\n\nJane Mara's Think Like an Entrepreneur: The Mindset of Success demystifies how serial entrepreneurs behave and what it takes to create successful business ventures.\n\nImportantly her research has focused on seeking an understanding of how successful repeat entrepreneurs integrate intuition and intentionality into recognising opportunities for business innovation and development.

Here from New York Times bestselling author Keith McFarland is a leadership fable for those wary of fables, a story that rejects pat, heard-it-before advice and shows–in a startlingly fresh way–how to use challenges to make both yourself and your organization stronger.\n\nMike Maloney, division manager for Boston-area tech firm CRX, returns from a business trip late one night feeling demoralized. His unit is about to lose its biggest customer and its most valuable employee. Mike wonders how much longer he and his staff can keep up their relentless work schedule and meet upper management’s new request for cost cuts. Something has to give. Hoping to blow off steam, he heads to a gym, where he runs into Joe, a former army Ranger.\n\nAfter listening to Mike vent about the cards he’s been dealt, the ex-soldier says, \"Sounds like your company is ready to bounce.\" Mike looks confused, so Joe begins tutoring him in lessons from the battlefield. It is precisely when all seems lost, says Joe, that the opportunity exists to rethink a situation and make real progress. \n\nOver the next two weeks, Joe turns Mike’s view of himself and his company upside down. Despite his Ivy League MBA and extensive experience running companies, Mike has a lot to learn from this young grunt just back from Afghanistan. For example, he learns that under pressure, people experience two kinds of anxiety–one that hurts performance and one that helps it. Mike uses the insight to get his troops running toward the sound of gunfire, and in the process, learns that \"bounce\" can happen outside the workplace, too. With Joe’s help, he finds his own personal bounce.\n\nDrawing inspiration from such sources as the work of M.I.T. social scientist Ed Schein, the film Saving Private Ryan, and his own experiences as a CEO leading companies, McFarland cleverly weaves a story whose practical insights can be put to use immediately. With an invaluable wrap-up section at the book’s end that analyzes each of the key ideas and shows how they can be applied in work and personal life, Bounce may be the most indispensable guide to facing challenges ever written.\n\n\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\n  ...more"

Since then, her ongoing lawsuit against Encana, Alberta Environment, and the Energy Resources Conservation Board has made her a folk hero in many places worldwide where fracking is underway. In this powerful work of investigative journalism, Andrew Nikiforuk interweaves Ernst’s story with the science of fracking and stories of human and environmental repercussions left in its wake.

And the epic choices he and his opponents made-on the battlefield and elsewhere in life-offer lessons about responding to our victories and our defeats that are as relevant today as they were more than 2,000 years ago. A big new idea book inspired by ancient history, Hannibal and Me explores the truths behind triumph and disaster in our lives by examining the decisions made by Hannibal and others, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Steve Jobs, Ernest Shackleton, and Paul Cézanne-men and women who learned from their mistakes.\n  By showing why some people overcome failure and others succumb to it, and why some fall victim to success while others thrive on it, Hannibal and Me demonstrates how to recognize the seeds of success within our own failures and the threats of failure hidden in our successes. The result is a page-turning adventure tale, a compelling human drama, and an insightful guide to understanding behavior. This is essential reading for anyone who seeks to transform misfortune into success at work, at home, and in life.\n\n  ...more"

Over the years, Ury has discovered that the greatest obstacle to successful agreements and satisfying relationships is not the other side, as difficult as they can be. The biggest obstacle is actually ourselves—our natural tendency to react in ways that do not serve our true interests.\n\nBut this obstacle can also become our biggest opportunity, Ury argues. If we learn to understand and influence ourselves first, we lay the groundwork for understanding and influencing others.\n\nIn this indispensable prequel to Getting to Yes, Ury draws deeply on his personal and professional experience negotiating conflicts around the world to present a practical method to help you get to yes with yourself first, dra-matically improving your ability to get to yes with others.\n\nExtraordinarily useful and elegantly simple, Getting to Yes with Yourself is an essential guide to achieving the inner satisfaction that will, in turn, make your life better, your relationships healthier, your family happier, your work more productive, and the world around you more peaceful.\n  ...more"

For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.\n\nWhy do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. \n\nWe concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”\n\nFor years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.\n\nElegant, startling, and universal in its applications The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. \n\nThe Black Swan is a landmark book – itself a black swan.\n\nThe book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and, a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index.\n  ...more"

Commerce, business, supply and demand, entrepreneurs, corporations, and other business-related ideas have become second nature to most areas of the planet. Given the collective interest in and significance of business, people naturally want to become experts. They read newspapers, study the stock market, enroll in business school, and even design career paths so that they can become a business professional. Some people are of the opinion that true business insight and savvy can only come from formal academic institutions, while others argue that real world experience is the best teacher. There are positive and negative arguments for both of those lines of logic. This book is meant to bridge the gap between stuffy lecture halls and experience-building employment. The idea of encapsulating an entire MBA in a single book may seem overly bold or unrealistic, but by boiling down the concepts of business success and modern theory into a single book, it becomes far less intimidating for readers who want to push their career forward, regardless of where they are in the business hierarchy. This book contains everything from invaluable reminders for CEOs to inspiring advice for first-time, start-up entrepreneurs. Becoming a powerful and successful business professional is a never-ending journey, because you will always be learning and developing your skills, adapting them to the dynamic world of modern business. This book helps to facilitate that educational process, providing the real-world examples of business skills, knowledge components, foundational qualities, and professional tools that can push you in the right direction. If you're starting a business, running a business, or looking for a job, you probably don't have much time to enroll in business school, read a dozen dry textbooks on corporate theory, or constantly stay appraised of every new development in global commerce. While this book may not answer all your questions about how to find success, it will highlight the most important elements on the road to becoming a desirable, effective, and powerful business professional. By drawing from some of the most successful business models and business professionals in recent history, you can look at problems from new perspectives and hopefully find some inspiration from some of the greatest minds of our generation. From international titans like Walmart and Amazon to crowdsourcing sites and charitable retailers, there are lessons to be learnt on every one of these pages, no matter what size company you work for or what ambitious plans you have for your new enterprise. The MBA Book simplifies the business process by incrementally moving from the conceptual foundation of a company to the final touches, including the skills and tools that an established company should tweak and perfect in order to remain competitive and successful.\n  ...more"

Hunt revolutionized three different sports—pro football, tennis, and soccer—winding up in the Hall of Fame of each. Drawing on 50 years of Hunt’s personal papers and more than 200 interviews, MacCambridge provides an intimate, original portrait of the man forever captivated by these serious pursuits we call games.     \n\n\"I can't separate what part of pro football is business and what part is personal with me,\" he said. \"I just know that it is very important that I succeed.\"\n\nHe had loved games as a young boy, had played them as a young man, and now, as a naive but determined 27-year-old in the summer of 1959, Lamar Hunt announced that he was going to launch a new football league.\n\nWhat he couldn't possibly have known on that day was that the forces of the entrenched National Football League would soon be arrayed against him. The league would place its own team in his hometown of Dallas, in direct competition with his team, and would attempt to undermine the new league, trying on repeated occasions before that first season to prevent the new American Football League from ever starting.\n\nAnd what the NFL couldn't have known, but would soon find out, was that Hunt, the mild-mannered, bespectacled son of legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, had an indomitable will, and patience beyond his years. Resolute and innovative, he successfully launched the AFL and, seven years later, helped broker a merger deal, which created the need for a championship game between the two leagues. Then he came up with the name of the game--the Super Bowl.\n\nNever before, and not since, has anyone with so many resources spent so much time watching, participating in, and being captivated by the absorbing ritual of sports and the suspended state of play. His accomplishments would put him in the company of the other giants of American sports--Charles C. \"Cash and Carry\" Pyle, Abe Saperstein, George Halas, Branch Rickey, Red Auerbach, Pete Rozelle. Each was present at a revolution. But Hunt, significantly, was present at a number of revolutions. And he was the catalyst for each one. Before his death in 2006, Hunt revolutionized three different sports--pro football, tennis, and soccer--winding up in the Hall of Fame of each.\n\nWritten by award-winning author Michael MacCambridge, Lamar Hunt: A Life In Sports is the definitive and official biography of one of the 20th century's most important and beloved sporting figures; the soft-spoken, strong-willed man whose audacious challenge to the NFL transformed the landscape of American sports, but only served as an opening act to his epic sporting journey. Drawing on 50 years of Hunt's personal papers and more than 200 interviews, author Michael MacCambridge provides an intimate, original portrait of the man forever captivated by these serious pursuits we call games.\n  ...more"

By working collaboratively across boundaries, they are exploring and putting into place unprecedented solutions that move beyond just being “less bad” to creating pathways that will enable us to flourish in an increasingly interdependent world. Among the stories in these pages are the evolution of Sweden’s “Green Zone,” Alcoa’s water use reduction goals, GE’s ecoimagination initiative, and Seventh Generation’s decision to shift some of their advertising to youth-led social change programs.\n\nAt its heart, THE NECESSARY REVOLUTION contains a wealth of strategies that individuals and organizations can use — specific tools and ways of thinking — to help us build the confidence and competence to respond effectively to the greatest challenge of our time.

They ranged from all the usual FAANG suspects to darling unicorns such as Coinbase, TikTok, and Grab. We asked everyone two simple questions:\nWhat knowledge separates interview candidates you hire from those you don't?\nWhat hard skills help PMs advance their careers the fastest?\nGiven that we talked to product leaders across the world who worked in various different countries and industries, we expected to see no clear pattern in our responses. We were shocked to find a common theme across all of our interviews. The knowledge and skills which separated exceptional PMs from the rest all boiled down to seven subjects: product design, economics, psychology, user experience, data science, law & policy, and marketing & growth.\n\nThe average PM excels at 2 or 3 of these disciplines. A truly world-class product manager, however, thrives in all 7.

Many people are familiar with Warren Buffett’s analogy of a moat: various defenses to thwart competition. But moats are fleeting; they are here today and gone tomorrow. The more important question is, who builds and maintains moats? \n \nIntelligent fanatics do. These leaders build high-performance organizations that can dominate for decades. \n \nIntelligent Fanatics Project looks at the stories of eight intelligent fanatics who built dominant and enduring businesses. A $1,000 investment with each of these intelligent fanatics would, on average, have been worth $3.4 million thirty-seven years later—a 24.6% compounded annual return. They operated in a wide array of industries, in different time periods, on different continents, and against different economic backdrops, yet their leadership styles, strategies, corporate cultures, and values were similar. \n \nIntelligent fanatics are what every entrepreneur aspires to be and what every long-term investor dreams of finding and investing in early. Sean Iddings and Ian Cassel examine the common traits of these intelligent fanatics, to help both the investor and the entrepreneur generate extraordinary returns. \n\n  ...more"

This notion follows us into adulthood, where we tend to simply accept these established beliefs about our skillsets (i.e. that we don’t have “a math brain” or that we aren’t “the creative type”). These damaging—and as new science has revealed, false—assumptions have influenced all of us at some time, affecting our confidence and willingness to try new things and limiting our choices, and, ultimately, our futures.\n\nStanford University professor, bestselling author, and acclaimed educator Jo Boaler has spent decades studying the impact of beliefs and bias on education. In \n  Limitless Mind\n, she explodes these myths and reveals the six keys to unlocking our boundless learning potential. Her research proves that those who achieve at the highest levels do not do so because of a genetic inclination toward any one skill but because of the keys that she reveals in the book. Our brains are not “fixed,” but entirely capable of change, growth, adaptability, and rewiring. Want to be fluent in mathematics? Learn a foreign language? Play the guitar? Write a book? The truth is not only that anyone at any age can learn anything, but the act of learning itself fundamentally changes who we are, and as Boaler argues so elegantly in the pages of this book, what we go on to achieve.\n\n \n  ...more"

The book soared to the top of bestseller lists internationally, igniting global conversations about women and ambition. Sandberg packed theatres, dominated opinion pages, appeared on every major television show and on the cover of Time magazine, and sparked ferocious debate about women and leadership. Ask most women whether they have the right to equality at work and the answer will be a resounding yes, but ask the same women whether they'd feel confident asking for a raise, a promotion, or equal pay, and some reticence creeps in. The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour – of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg – Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business – draws on her own experience of working in some of the world's most successful businesses and looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale.\n  ...more"

Silver's coverage is polymathic, ranging from poker and earthquakes to climate change and terrorism.\"\n-New York Review of Books\n\nNate Silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance, predicted the 2008 election within a hair's breadth, and became a national sensation as a blogger-all by the time he was thirty. He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight.com.\n \nDrawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the \"prediction paradox\": The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.\n\nIn keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good-or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary-and dangerous-science.\n\nSilver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.\n\nWith everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver's insights are an essential read.\n  ...more"

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset — those who believe that abilities are fixed — are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset — those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.\n\nIn this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love — to transform their lives and your own.\n  ...more"

His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. \n\nAt age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. \n\nMartin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of Saturday Night Live in the seventies.\n\nThroughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before.

It was the Protestant ethic whose characteristics--thrift, a respect for enquiry, individualism tempered by a need to cooperate, success as a measure of divine approval--helped to create the conditions which led to America's managerial and corporate success. Thus, the authors contend, the drive, energy and acceptance of innovation, competition, growth and social mobility, all have their origins in the discipline and ethos of America's first wave of European immigrants: the Puritans.

Buy it.\" - Tim Ferriss\n\n\"This is a life-learning lesson for everyone... the book is awesome.\" - Sean Hannity\n\nSent to the most violent battlefield in Iraq, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin’s SEAL task unit faced a seemingly impossible mission: help U.S. forces secure Ramadi, a city deemed “all but lost.” In gripping firsthand accounts of heroism, tragic loss, and hard-won victories in SEAL Team Three’s Task Unit Bruiser, they learned that leadership—at every level—is the most important factor in whether a team succeeds or fails.Willink and Babin returned home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training that helped forge the next generation of SEAL leaders. After departing the SEAL Teams, they launched Echelon Front, a company that teaches these same leadership principles to businesses and organizations. From promising startups to Fortune 500 companies, Babin and Willink have helped scores of clients across a broad range of industries build their own high-performance teams and dominate their battlefields.\nNow, detailing the mind-set and principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult missions in combat, Extreme Ownership shows how to apply them to any team, family or organization. Each chapter focuses on a specific topic such as Cover and Move, Decentralized Command, and Leading Up the Chain, explaining what they are, why they are important, and how to implement them in any leadership environment.\nA compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, Extreme Ownership revolutionizes business management and challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.\n  ...more"

The DST is a synthesis of one hundred years of real estate, securities, and tax laws that provide an investment entity that allows the modern real estate investor to build a diversified portfolio of institutional grade real estate under protective securities regulations and enjoy the tax advantages of gain nonrecognition using IRC section 1031 like-kind exchanges. The book not only introduces the DST but also guides the reader through the investment process by providing perspective in the choosing of brokers, sponsors, and properties as well as a more in-depth analysis of the DST offering (John Harvey, CPA, MBT, author). The book provides a clear explanation of DST's and how they provide opportunities for smaller investors access to institutional properties otherwise not available to them, because of the large equity requirements and access to reasonable financing. The 1031 exchange is linked very nicely, explaining the DST opportunity for diversification in more than one investment that helps balance overall risk in the 1031 exchange. Trump tax plan is expertly explained and its impact on the DST structure. Book describes clear example of the tax savings of a 1031 exchange and the benefit of compounding on deferred taxes avoided at time sale. Good examples of dos and don'ts in the 1031 exchange (Kosmas G. Toskos, DST investor).\n  ...more"

Meanwhile, people with important ideas--entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists--struggle to make them \"stick.\"\n\nIn Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds--from the infamous \"kidney theft ring\" hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits.\n\nMade to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It's a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.\n\nProvocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas--and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.\n  ...more"

What would have to happen from this point going forward for you to live a life of no regrets?Regrets are a waste of time anyway, as you can't change the past. So, let go of the past and decide to choose to live your life with no regrets from this day forward.Living a life of no regrets doesn't mean perfection. It means that we choose to make decisions with a little more thought. When we look back on the choices we have made, will we regret any of the choices?Is a successful and happy life with few or no regrets a choice....? Is success a choice or a chance collision of various uncontrollable factors?In studying self-improvement, we learn that we can't change others, nor can we single-handedly change the world. However, we do have the power to change our own lives. This is the single most important message in self-improvement. You do not have to settle for what you think is life's role for you. You are not doomed to live a life you are unhappy living. You are not enslaved to other people. Any and all of these self-limiting beliefs can be overcome.If what you are currently doing doesn't serve you, you can choose to change it right now. You can choose to start by taking 'baby' steps. Start by having a day without regrets. How about a business trip where you don't have any regrets? What would a vacation without regrets look like and feel like? What would have to happen to have an argument or 'touchy' conversation with your spouse or child without regrets? How would you have a conversation with a client you don't enjoy and not have any regrets? How would you communicate with employees who may not be working to your expectations and not have any regrets? Could you have a day of making everyday business decisions and personal choices without any regrets?What would a day without regrets look like and feel like? What would a week of no regrets look like and feel like? What would a month of no regrets look like and feel like? Invest in this program today and start life with no regrets tomorrow.\n  ...more"

Started in their mother's laundry room in Germany, Adi and Rudi Dassler's shoe business was an instant success, their spikes worn by Jesse Owens in the Berlin Olympics. But a vicious feud soon pulled them apart: by the end of World War II, the brothers split the company, dividing their family and hometown.\n\nAdidas and Puma revolutionized the world of sport, their rivalry introducing behind-the-scenes deals and multimillion-dollar contracts. From Pelé to Joe Namath, Walt Frazier to Boris Becker, Muhammad Ali to David Beckham, they all contribute to the roller-coaster rise, near collapse, and revival of the two brands. A page-turning narrative, Sneaker Wars is a riveting blend of family drama, business, sports, and history.\n  ...more"

While every new generation has faced its share of disruption in technology, economics, politics and society, no other generation in the history of mankind has had the ability to connect every human being on the planet to each other and in the process to provide the opportunity for each person to be fully educated, socially and economically engaged.\n\nWhat might this mean for business, markets, and educational institutions in the future? In this revolutionary new book, The Gen Z Effect: How the Hyperconnected Generation is Changing Business and Society Forever, authors Tom Koulopoulos and Dan Keldsen delve into a vision of the future where disruptive invention and reinvention is the acknowledged norm, touching almost every aspect of how we work, live and play. From radical new approaches to marketing and manufacturing to the potential obliteration of intellectual property and the shift to mass innovation, to the decimation of our oldest learning institutions through open source and adaptive learning, The Gen Z Effect provides a mind-bending view of why we will need to embrace Gen Z as the last, best hope for taking on the world’s biggest challenges and opportunities, and how you can prepare yourself and your business for the greatest era of disruption, prosperity, and progress the world has ever experienced.\n\n  ...more"

No organization—or individual—can successfully compete in the marketplace, achieve goals and objectives, provide outstanding service, engage in exceptional teamwork, or develop people without personal accountability.   \n\nJohn G. Mille\n  The lack of personal accountability is a problem that has resulted in an epidemic of blame, victim thinking, complaining, and procrastination. No organization—or individual—can successfully compete in the marketplace, achieve goals and objectives, provide outstanding service, engage in exceptional teamwork, or develop people without personal accountability.   \n\nJohn G. Miller believes that the troubles that plague organizations cannot be solved by pointing fingers and blaming others. Rather, the real solutions are found when each of us recognizes the power of personal accountability. In QBQ! The Question Behind the Question®, Miller explains how negative, ill-focused questions like “Why do we have to go through all this change?” and “Who dropped the ball?” represent a lack of personal accountability. Conversely, when we ask better questions—QBQs—such as “What can I do to contribute?” or “How can I help solve the problem?” our lives and our organizations are transformed.\n\n\nTHE QBQ! PROMISE\n\nThis remarkable and timely book provides a practical method for putting personal accountability into daily actions, with astonishing results: problems are solved, internal barriers come down, service improves, teams thrive, and people adapt to change more quickly. QBQ! is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to learn, grow, and change. Using this tool, each of us can add tremendous worth to our organizations and to our lives by eliminating blame, victim-thinking, and procrastination.\n\n                                                                                                 \nQBQ! was written more than a decade ago and has helped countless readers practice personal accountability at work and at home. This version features a new foreword, revisions and new material throughout, and a section of  FAQs that the author has received over the years.\n\n\n\n\n  ...more"

But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.\n\nConsidered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.\n\nMany current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.\n  ...more"

The author says, \"What a relief after eight years of economic stagna­tion and government over-regulation.\" Oddly, as the U.S. economy has benefited from pro-growth policies, like tax rate cuts and deregulation, there exists a rising tide of sympathy for socialism among leftist politicians and young people.\n\n This timeless divide between capitalism and socialism is explored within the context of the economic and moral ramifications for society in general and long-term investors, specifically.\n\n Readers with historical perspective will appreciate the logic of what should be obvious, i.e. that socialism has never worked anywhere on earth. Or aptly put by President Ronald Reagan, \"Socialism can only work in two places, heaven where they don't need it, and hell where they already have it.\"\n\n This book is about participating in the capital markets while avoiding morally objectionable businesses. As a lover of the free enterprise system and a portfolio manager,  George Schwartz chronicles how Morally Responsible Investing is helping long-term investors put their money to work in accordance with their moral beliefs. His firm manages Ave Maria Mutual Funds, which were founded in 2001. These pro-life and pro-family mutual funds have attracted over 100,000 shareholders, who have invested more than $2.2 billion in five separate award-winning mutual funds.\n  ...more"

These threats keep corporate leaders up at night. What can companies do to stay alive? \n\nSurvive and Thrive: Winning Against Strategic Threats to Your Business features a collection of essays by strategy professors at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, Canada’s #1 business school. The essays take the reader on a tour through some of the most vexing threats to business today, threats that put the very existence of organizations into question. From disruptive innovation, to social media disasters, to mistaken technical investments, to gender discrimination, to misunderstood competition, companies need to be able to anticipate crises and prepare to deal with them head on. Across this collection of essays, readers will get warnings about four mistakes that companies commonly make – failing to appreciate interactions within systems, getting stuck in existing ways of doing business, falling victim to cognitive biases, and getting derailed by short-term incentives.\n\nBut, this book isn’t just about mistakes. Its primary goal is to provide step-by-step actions to help companies stay alive. Executives will find principles and practices for anticipating potential threats and creating responses that permit their businesses to not only survive but thrive.\n\nEditor Joshua S. Gans is a professor of Strategic Management and holds the Jeffrey S. Skoll Chair of Technical Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Rotman School of Management. He is also chief economist of the University of Toronto’s Creative Destruction Lab. Gans wrote The Disruption Dilemma, Information Wants to be Shared, and several other books.\n\nEditor Sarah Kaplan, Director of the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the Rotman School of Management, is also Distinguished Professor of Gender and the Economy and a professor of Strategic Management at Rotman.

It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.\n\nRather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late.

Yet by 1930 Americans in every corner of the country accepted the hamburger as a mainstream meal and eventually made it a staple of their diet. The quintessential \"American\" food, hamburgers have by now spread to almost every country and culture in the world. But how did this fast food icon come to occupy so quickly such a singular role in American mass culture?\n\nIn Selling 'em By the Sack, David Gerard Hogan traces the history of the hamburger's rise as a distinctive American culinary and ethnic symbol through the prism of one of its earliest promoters. The first to market both the hamburger and the \"to go\" carry-out style to American consumers, White Castle quickly established itself as a cornerstone of the fast food industry. Its founder, Billy Ingram, shrewdly marketed his hamburgers in large quantities at five cents a piece, telling his customers to \"Buy'em by the Sack.\"\n\nThe years following World War II saw the rise of great franchised chains such as McDonald's, which challenged and ultimately overshadowed the company that Billy Ingram founded. Yet White Castle stands as a charismatic pioneer in one of America's most formidable industries, a company that drastically changed American eating patterns, and hence, American life. It could be argued that what Henry Ford did for the car and transportation, Billy Ingram did for the hamburger and eating.\n  ...more"

What you make with what you have, what you started out with. Wilson would be the first to point out that there are investors richer than himself; but on a percentage-return basis, he is unmatched, and untouched. He received $15,000 from his mother in 1958, and he ran this stake to the fabulous sum of $230 million, by 1986. With assistance he himself sought out, he then nearly quadrupled his net worth to $800 million, by the year 2000. This return, after taxes no less, is more than 50,000 to one. More than 5,000,000 percent. Wilson did it in about forty years, without partners. How? How, possibly? This book, \"Killing the Market,\" tries to find, or at least get close to, an answer. Robert Wilson quit the investing business in 1986, because he had \"lost his touch,\" as he said. The most productive of men, the hardest working of men, he started to move into philanthropy. Eventually he became just about the most important philanthropist in the United States. Of the $800 million he accumulated, he had given away fully $700 million of it at the time of his death, in 2013 (by his own hand). Movingly, Robert Wilson's gifts were never to things that entertained him, or to pet projects; they were always to charities trying very hard to make the world a better place for everybody.\n  ...more"

Many species have exerted enormous influence on the biosphere's character and productivity, but none has transformed the Earth in so many ways and on such a scale as Homo sapiens. In Harvesting the Biosphere, Vaclav Smil offers an interdisciplinary and quantitative account of human claims on the biosphere's stores of living matter, from prehistory to the present day. Smil examines all harvests--from prehistoric man's hunting of megafauna to modern crop production--and all uses of harvested biomass, including energy, food, and raw materials. Without harvesting of the biomass, Smil points out, there would be no story of human evolution and advancing civilization; but at the same time, the increasing extent and intensity of present-day biomass harvests are changing the very foundations of civilization's well-being.\n\nIn his detailed and comprehensive account, Smil presents the best possible quantifications of past and current global losses in order to assess the evolution and extent of biomass harvests. Drawing on the latest work in disciplines ranging from anthropology to environmental science, Smil offers a valuable long-term, planet-wide perspective on human-caused environmental change.\n  ...more"

McLean finds that fracking is a business built on attracting ever-more gigantic amounts of capital investment, while promises of huge returns have yet to bear out.

Part One focuses on the exponential technologies that are disrupting today’s Fortune 500 companies and enabling upstart entrepreneurs to go from \"I’ve got an idea\" to \"I run a billion-dollar company\" far faster than ever before. The authors provide exceptional insight into the power of 3D printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, networks and sensors, and synthetic biology. Part Two of the book focuses on the Psychology of Bold, drawing on insights from billionaire entrepreneurs Larry Page, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos. In addition, Diamandis reveals his entrepreneurial secrets garnered from building fifteen companies, including such audacious ventures as Singularity University, XPRIZE, Planetary Resources, and Human Longevity, Inc. Finally, Bold closes with a look at the best practices that allow anyone to leverage today’s hyper-connected crowd like never before. Here, the authors teach how to design and use incentive competitions, launch million-dollar crowdfunding campaigns to tap into ten’s of billions of dollars of capital, and finally how to build communities—armies of exponentially enabled individuals willing and able to help today’s entrepreneurs make their boldest dreams come true.\n\nBold is both a manifesto and a manual.

To make organizational change work, you need to base it on science, not intuition. \n\nIn \"The Science of Organizational Change, \"Paul Gibbons offers the first blueprint for change for that fully reflects the newest advances in neuroscience, behavioral economics, sociology, and complexity theory. Starting with a rigorous and evidence-based understanding of what makes people in organizations tick, he presents a complete framework for organizing your company around successful change. Going broader and deeper than any previous discussion of the subject, Gibbons offers a much needed multi-disciplinary approach that reflects the complex and difficult realities of changing modern organizations. \n\nYou'll learn:\n - How a deeper understanding of flaws in human decision-making can help you make far better choices when the stakes are largest\n\n - How new advances in neuroscience have altered best practices in influencing colleagues, negotiating with partners, engaging followers' hearts, minds, and behaviors, and managing resistance\nHow to bring greater meaning and mindfulness to your organization - and reap their benefits\n\n - How new ideas from analytics, forecasting, and risk are humbling those who \"thought\" they knew the future - and what to do with this new, more mature understanding\n\n - How to improve your boardroom, promoting more effective conversations about strategy, ethics, and decision-making\nWhat chaos and complexity theories mean in the context of your own business\n\n - How to create resilient and agile business cultures, and anti-fragile, dynamic business structures\n\nTo link science with your \"on-the-ground\" reality, Gibbons interviews top CEOs who are applying its principles. You'll find case studies from well-known companies like IBM and Shell, and deeply relevant quotations from history's greatest leaders and thinkers. Change will never be easy. To systematically improve your odds, you need science, a framework built on science, and actionable lessons from leaders who've made change work. \"You need Paul Gibbons' The Science of Organizational Change.\"\n  ...more"

Today, when everyone is connected, collaboration is the game changer. Agencies and firms, citizens and groups who can collaborate, Bratton and Tumin argue, will thrive in the networked world; those who can’t are doomed to perish.\n\nNo one today is better known around the world for his ability to get citizens, governments, and industries working together to improve the safety of cities than William Bratton. At Harvard, Zachary Tumin has led senior executives from government and industry in executive sessions and classrooms for over a decade, burnishing a global reputation for insight and leadership. Together, Bratton and Tumin draw on in-depth accounts from Fortune 100 giants such as Alcoa, Wells Fargo, and Toyota; from masters of collaboration in education, social work, and the military; and from Bratton’s own storied career. Among the specific strategies they reveal:\n\n   • Start collaboration with a broad vision that supporters can add to and make their own \n   • Rightsize problems, and get value in the hands of users fast \n   • Get the right people involved—from sponsors to grass roots \n   • Make collaboration pay in the right currency—whether recognition, rewards, or revenue \n\nToday companies and managers face unique challenges—and opportunities—in reaching out to others, thanks to the incredibly connected world in which we live. Bratton and Tumin provide practical strategies anyone can use, from the cubicle to the boardroom. This is the ultimate guide to getting things done in today’s networked world.\n  ...more"

But few people know that when it came to the behavior of individuals—the way we perceive ourselves, the way we treat others, and the decisions we make in pursuit of happiness—the Scottish philosopher had just as much to say. He developed his ideas on human nature in an epic, sprawling work titled The Theory of Moral Sentiments. \n\nMost economists have never read it, and for most of his life, Russ Roberts was no exception. But when he finally picked up the book by the founder of his field, he realized he’d stumbled upon what might be the greatest self-help book that almost no one has read.\n\nIn How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life, Roberts examines Smith’s forgotten masterpiece, and finds a treasure trove of timeless, practical wisdom. Smith’s insights into human nature are just as relevant today as they were three hundred years ago. What does it takes to be truly happy? Should we pursue fame and fortune or the respect of our friends and family? How can we make the world a better place? Smith’s unexpected answers, framed within the rich context of current events, literature, history, and pop culture, are at once profound, counter-intuitive, and highly entertaining. \n\nIn reinvigorating this neglected classic, this book provides us with an invaluable look at human behavior through the lens of one of history’s greatest minds.\n  ...more"

Shareholders, the media, and even the government are now questioning the charmed existence of these Olympian figures. Gideon Haigh investigates the whole cult that has grown up around the CEO, questioning why we need him, why a man almost always holds the position, what the CEO's actual duties are, and why he is paid so much more than the rest of the workforce. In a tough-minded, vigorous demolition job on the culture that produced the cult of the CEO, Haigh writes a mini history of business and shows how the traditions of capitalism are mocked by the managerial system of the present. This humorous and incisive essay demystifies the world of big business. The cult of the CEO has never been exposed so entertainingly or irreverently.\n  ...more"

Porter's Competitive Strategy has transformed the theory, practice, and teaching of business strategy throughout the world. Electrifying in its simplicity -- like all great breakthroughs -- Porter's analysis of industries captures the complexity of industry competition in five underlying forces. Porter introduces one of the most powerful competitive tools yet developed: his three generic strategies -- lowest cost, differentiation, and focus -- which bring structure to the task of strategic positioning. He shows how competitive advantage can be defined in terms of relative cost and relative prices, thus linking it directly to profitability, and presents a whole new perspective on how profit is created and divided. In the almost two decades since publication, Porter's framework for predicting competitor behavior has transformed the way in which companies look at their rivals and has given rise to the new discipline of competitor assessment.  More than a million managers in both large and small companies, investment analysts, consultants, students, and scholars throughout the world have internalized Porter's ideas and applied them to assess industries, understand competitors,, and choose competitive positions. The ideas in the book address the underlying fundamentals of competition in a way that is independent of the specifics of the ways companies go about competing.  Competitive Strategy has filled a void in management thinking. It provides an enduring foundation and grounding point on which all subsequent work can be built. By bringing a disciplined structure to the question of how firms achieve superior profitability, Porter's rich frameworks and deep insights comprise a sophisticated view of competition unsurpassed in the last quarter-century.\n  ...more"

Visit: readersfavorite.com/book-review/unbar... *** Winner of 2016 Northern California Book Festival Award in Business Category *** Finalist in the 5th Annual Beverly Hills International Book Awards 2016 *** Mayur Ramgir, an innovator, entrepreneur and an International Award Winning Author, puts his Sherlock hat on and picks up Watson's pen to retrace a story of success and jot it down for the others to follow. He tells the story of how successful people found their pathway to discoveries that took them to the heights where we now see them. He tells the tale, not just of achievements, but also of failures, and more importantly, of getting back on the feet after those failures. Unbarred Innovation: A Pathway to Greatest Discoveries is written as a source of inspiration for those who doubt the destiny. Ramgir narrates the story of great innovators with the intention of helping readers find out that those are the people they can relate to, and their achievements are nothing but the result of unwavering determination and efforts. Those are the people who take failure an opportunity to overcome the flawed and feeble aspects of their strategies. They improve and strengthen themselves after every stumble, rising up stronger and better than ever before. He explores the element that differentiates them from everyone else. Is it genetic superiority or a gift of opportunities? Is it really something they are born with, or is it something they take from what they observe and experience? With his belief in the latter theory, Ramgir inspects their lives to identify the difference of a whole new level. His own journey to success is based on what he had been learning from the lives of people who inspire him. From Larry Ellison to Li Ka-shing, he had put the lives of these living giants under the microscope to understand what they do different and how they fostered the innovator in themselves. The book is a detailed account of Ramgir's learning. Like Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey, Ramgir's story is also more than just words of inspiration. He writes his book as a guide that takes the reader on the path to self-discovery. From philosophy to believes and from perception to action, follow Ramgir as he uncovers the secret lifestyle that successful people live by. Understand the idea of Unbarred Innovation and how it can help you join the league of modern innovators regardless of your current circumstances and challenges. Find out how you can take the smallest idea out of your mind, polish it, and present it to the world in a way that changes everything, not just for the world but also for you. Be the modern day innovator, raise future innovators, and find out how innovation can pave way to entrepreneurship. It is important to note that all the proceeds generated by this book will be donated for charitable causes such as providing education, shelter, food and basic needs for underprivileged children, eradicating poverty, hunger and solving social and global issues.\n  ...more"

In 1999, legendary venture capitalist John Doerr invested nearly $12 million in a startup that had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. Doerr introduced the founders to OKRs and with them at the foundation of their management, the startup grew from forty employees to more than 70,000 with a market cap exceeding $600 billion. The startup was Google. Since then Doerr has introduced OKRs to more than fifty companies, helping tech giants and charities exceed all expectations. In the OKR model objectives define what we seek to achieve and key results are how those top­ priority goals will be attained. OKRs focus effort, foster coordination and enhance workplace satisfaction. They surface an organization's most important work as everyone's goals from entry-level to CEO are transparent to the entire institution.  In Measure What Matters, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations.  This book will show you how to collect timely, relevant data to track progress - to measure what matters. It will help any organization or team aim high, move fast, and excel. \n  ...more"

Today it is damaged, discouraged, and fighting for its future. In Glass House, journalist Brian Alexander uses the story of one town to show how seeds sown 35 years ago have sprouted to give us Trumpism, inequality, and an eroding national cohesion.\n\nThe Anchor Hocking Glass Company, once the world’s largest maker of glass tableware, was the base on which Lancaster’s society was built. As Glass House unfolds, bankruptcy looms. With access to the company and its leaders, and Lancaster’s citizens, Alexander shows how financial engineering took hold in the 1980s, accelerated in the 21st Century, and wrecked the company. We follow CEO Sam Solomon as he tries to rescue the company from the New York private equity firm that hired him. Meanwhile, Alexander goes behind the scenes, entwined with the lives of residents as they wrestle with heroin, politics, high-interest lenders, low wage jobs, technology, and the new demands of American life: people like Brian Gossett, the fourth generation to work at Anchor Hocking; Joe Piccolo, first-time director of the annual music festival who discovers the town relies on him, and it, for salvation; Jason Roach, who police believed may have been Lancaster’s biggest drug dealer; and Eric Brown, a local football hero-turned-cop who comes to realize that he can never arrest Lancaster’s real problems.\n  ...more"

Scaling Up: How a Few Companies Make It...and Why the Rest Don't is the first major revision of this business classic. In Scaling Up, Harnish and his team share practical tools and techniques for building an industry-dominating business. These approaches have been honed from over three decades of advising tens of thousands of CEOs and executives and helping them navigate the increasing complexities (and weight) that come with scaling up a venture. This book is written so everyone -- from frontline employees to senior executives -- can get aligned in contributing to the growth of a firm. There's no reason to do it alone, yet many top leaders feel like they are the ones dragging the rest of the organization up the S-curve of growth. The goal of this book is to help you turn what feels like an anchor into wind at your back -- creating a company where the team is engaged; the customers are doing your marketing; and everyone is making money. To accomplish this, Scaling Up focuses on the four major decision areas every company must get right: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. The book includes a series of new one-page tools including the updated One-Page Strategic Plan and the Rockefeller Habits ChecklistTM, which more than 40,000 firms around the globe have used to scale their companies successfully -- many to $1 billion and beyond. Running a business is ultimately about freedom. Scaling Up shows business leaders how to get their organizations moving in sync to create something significant and enjoy the ride.\n  ...more"

Quite frankly, it is hard to say, as usually when we are denied something, more frequently than not, we are never told why.\n\nFrom the statistics above, we can see that social media is a huge determining factor in whether or not us, our children or our friends and family are accepted into the college of our dreams or into our dream jobs. In my professional life, I have always been told that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In other words, it is better to be fully equipped and prepared for the opportunity as it arises, as opposed to wondering what we did wrong after we are passed up. Much like how a building must have their foundation built into the cornerstone that allows it to withstand the tests of time, we must have our foundation etched and chiseled out so we can be the best that we can be. This book, The Etiquette of Social Media, is the complete guide on the basic foundation that we all need to ensure that our online image is bulletproof from being judged by the decision makers of the world who may be able to have control of our destiny.\n \nSocial Media is paving the way of the future. It is a new trend that is becoming standardized as a part of our daily lives. This new standard includes media outlets ranging from Facebook to LinkedIn to Quora and Twitter, along with many others.\n \nWith how new social media is, there are no classes at our schools that cover the etiquette of social media. Whether you are in high school or a senior level executive, chances are you are oblivious to the guidelines of how to act on social media. In this day and age, that has been forgivable.\n\nWhy?\n \nBecause never before has there been a guide covering The Etiquette of Social Media, until now.\n\nInspired by best-selling author James Altucher, Leonard Kim decided to write his first book of many. Being a personality with high visibility and a Top Writer on Quora, an Online Knowledge Market, Leonard has seen it all.\n \nFrom comments to messages to public attacks, Leonard has broken free from the viewpoint we all have of what is right in front of us. He has been able to expand outside of the myopic bubble of the Internet we have all come to see. He has expanded his view of our online society as a whole. In a single year, Leonard went from being a nobody to having over five million views on the internet. He went from being an introvert with less friends than he has fingers to cultivating friendships all across the world.\n\nThrough decades of experience, Leonard has acquired a unique skill set. With a background in branding, Leonard understands the importance of your online reputation. He has been able to identify the key points to ensure that you come across as an approachable and likable human being.\n \nAre you looking to make new friends? Manage your online reputation? Or expand your business connections?\n \nThis book will provide you with the essential tools you need to get ahead.\n \nThe world is changing. Soon it will no longer be forgivable to be ignorant of your behavior on social media. People will start to judge you for each action you make. Read this guide to prepare yourself before that dreadfully awaited day finally arrives.\n  ...more"

As he follows the vision of his highly successful, results-at-all-costs mentor and CEO Allen Henley, Zack quietly nurtures a big dream--to create a new company of high morals and values, one that will revolutionize the world through the creation of wallpaper-thin displays to completely surround a viewer.\n\nThat dream is set into motion one morning when he realizes an important paper has been taken from his office. Moments later, Zack learns someone has turned him in. After his boss, who also happens to be the father of his girlfriend, Mary Anne, gives him one last chance to pledge his loyalty, Zack resigns. Determined to realize his vision, he soon steps into his new facility with high hopes and no idea that Henley has already put a plan into action with the intent of systematically destroying Zack, his perfect company, and, most of all, the relationship between Zack and Mary Anne, who is unwittingly caught in the cross-fire.\n\nIn this fast-paced thriller, a young entrepreneur faces moral dilemmas in Silicon Valley, a place where the inner working of the legal system favors the aggressor.\n  ...more"

The adjustment was smooth, my education in Chemistry didn’t fail me, and I found success in my early positions in the pharmaceutical industry. With success, came a greater need for me to speak in front of my peers and management. As is often the case in today’s world, I found that my success was becoming more and more tied to my ability to stand in a dimly lit room, and express or defend my work, in 30 minutes with 30 slides.\n\nUnlike my scientific education, I found that the training available to help me become a better presenter was nowhere near as complete or effective as I needed, until I came across Stop Presenting! \n\nThe clear and concise methodology you will find in this book quickly helped me become more effective. I immediately started relating to my audiences better, found myself more comfortable, and was more effective at getting my message across. There is a measure of genius in the simplicity of creating presentations that “answer questions” versus “spewing data”. I believe you will find yourself, as I did, more at ease in front of the room, because it becomes more of a conversation than a presentation. Nothing could be easier. I also found that the techniques in this book work in every communication medium; whether it’s a live presentation, conference call, or a video conference.\n\nThere is no question that my ability to present and speak in front of groups has allowed my knowledge and hard work to shine. In turn, it has provided me with countless job opportunities. I’m now the Managing Partner of a very successful consulting firm that works with some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Happily, I can tell you that I now love to be the person in front of the room, but I’ve learned to leave the lights on and only use a handful of slides.\n \nThanks Brian for writing such a helpful book.\n\nValarie Hegarty, M.S.\nManaging Partner, Innovative Strategy LLC\n\n  ...more"

This staggering amount of information—unprecedented in history—can tell us a great deal about who we are—the fears, desires, and behaviors that drive us, and the conscious and unconscious decisions we make. From the profound to the mundane, we can gain astonishing knowledge about the human psyche that less than twenty years ago, seemed unfathomable.\n\nEverybody Lies offers fascinating, surprising, and sometimes laugh-out-loud insights into everything from economics to ethics to sports to race to sex, gender and more, all drawn from the world of big data. What percentage of white voters didn’t vote for Barack Obama because he’s black? Does where you go to school effect how successful you are in life? Do parents secretly favor boy children over girls? Do violent films affect the crime rate? Can you beat the stock market? How regularly do we lie about our sex lives and who’s more self-conscious about sex, men or women?\n\nInvestigating these questions and a host of others, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz offers revelations that can help us understand ourselves and our lives better. Drawing on studies and experiments on how we really live and think, he demonstrates in fascinating and often funny ways the extent to which all the world is indeed a lab. With conclusions ranging from strange-but-true to thought-provoking to disturbing, he explores the power of this digital truth serum and its deeper potential—revealing biases deeply embedded within us, information we can use to change our culture, and the questions we’re afraid to ask that might be essential to our health—both emotional and physical. All of us are touched by big data everyday, and its influence is multiplying. Everybody Lies challenges us to think differently about how we see it and the world.\n  ...more"

Make tough decisions about which processes you must execute well, then implement the IT systems needed to digitize those processes. Citing numerous companies worldwide, the authors show how constructing the right enterprise architecture enhances profitability and time to market, improves strategy execution, and even lowers IT costs. Though clear, engaging explanation, they demonstrate how to define your operating model—your vision of how your firm will survive and grow—and implement it through your enterprise architecture. Their counterintuitive but vital message: when it comes to executing your strategy, your enterprise architecture may matter far more than your strategy itself.\n  ...more"

Energy Myths and Realities: Bringing Science to the Energy Policy Debate debunks the most common fallacies to make way for a constructive, scientific approach to the global energy challenge. When will the world run out of oil? Should nuclear energy be adopted on a larger scale? Are ethanol and wind power viable sources of energy for the future? Vaclav Smil advises the public to be wary of exaggerated claims and impossible promises. The global energy transition will be prolonged and expensive--and hinges on the development of an extensive new infrastructure. Established technologies and traditional energy sources are persistent and adaptable enough to see the world through that transition. Energy Myths and Realities brings a scientific perspective to an issue often dominated by groundless assertions, unfounded claims, and uncritical thinking.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.\n\nEngaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking.\n  ...more"

As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships--so that everyone wins. \nIn \"Never Eat Alone,\" Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps--and inner mindset--he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him. \nThe son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington's corridors of power to Hollywood's A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain's 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum. \nFerrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with \"networking.\" He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them: \nDon't keep score: It's never simply about getting what you want. It's about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too. \n\"Ping\" constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time--not just when you need something. \nNever eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you're working at a corporation or attending a society event-- \"invisibility\" is a fate worse than failure. \nIn the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world's most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama. \nChock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a \"conference commando,\" and more, \"Never Eat Alone\" is destined to take its place alongside \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" as an inspirational classic.\n  ...more"

Fortunately, behavioral economics studies show that such disasters stem from poor decisions due to our faulty mental patterns—what scholars call “cognitive biases”—and are preventable.\n\nUnfortunately, the typical advice for business leaders to “go with their guts” plays into these cognitive biases and leads to disastrous decisions that devastate the bottom line. By combining practical case studies with cutting-edge research, Never Go With Your Gut will help you make the best decisions and prevent these business disasters.\n\nThe leading expert on avoiding business disasters, Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, draws on over 20 years of extensive consulting, coaching, and speaking experience to show how pioneering leaders and organizations—many of them his clients—avoid business disasters.

In clear language, The Innovation Mandate shows leaders a step-by-step process to continually generate great ideas, implement them, and maximize their value to benefit both customers and investors.\n\n\nIn today’s ultra competitive marketplace, the difference between success and failure is innovation.

The book centers around three simple concepts:\n\n\nInnovation generates profits;\nInnovation, in the form of new, profitable ideas, can come from anywhere\nIdentifying, harnessing, evaluating, and implementing these new ideas cannot be left to chance\nAdditionally, the book offers a five-point checklist to ensure your company is innovation ready.\n  ...more"

For those of us directly involved in this research of the human brain, it is a very exciting time. However, very few people outside of the neuroscience community understand these discoveries well enough to take advantage of them or apply them to their own lives in a way that gets meaningful results. I see a need for simple, clear, accessible explanations of how to apply brain-based practices to greatly improve how we work and conduct business, so that everyone can benefit from use these discoveries. A few years ago, I was invited to write a series of articles for publication, with exactly that goal. This book is a collection of those articles. In addition to being supported by recent research of the human brain in the Western world, the articles in this book are also influenced by my knowledge of mindfulness and other ancient practices from the Eastern world. Interestingly, much of the recent neuroscience research confirms that many of these ancient Eastern practices do result in greatly improved brain functioning.

Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.\n\nIn Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.\n\nHere is a rare opportunity to gain proven advice unlike anything you’ll find in the conventional business press.\n  ...more"

It is a proven set of practices that have been tested and refined by hundreds of organizations and thousands of teams over many years.

And everybody knows it, even if we can't all agree on what, specifically, the problem is. Rising costs, changing climate, peaking oil, foreign oil, public safety--if the fears are this complicated, then the solutions are bound to be even more confusing. Maggie Koerth-Baker--science editor at the award-winning blog BoingBoing.net--finally makes some sense out of the madness. Over the next 20 years, we'll be forced to cut 20 quadrillion BTU worth of fossil fuels from our energy budget, by wasting less and investing in alternatives. To make it work, we'll need to radically change the energy systems that have shaped our lives for 100 years. And the result will be neither business-as-usual, nor a hippie utopia. Koerth-Baker explains what we can do, what we can't do, and why \"The Solution\" is really a lot of solutions working together. This isn't about planting a tree, buying a Prius, and proving that you're a good person. Economics and social incentives got us a country full of gas-guzzling cars, long commutes, inefficient houses, and coal-fired power plants out in the middle of nowhere, and economics and incentives will be the things that build our new world. Ultimately, change is inevitable.Argues we're not going to solve the energy problem by convincing everyone to live like it's 1900 because that's not a good thing. Instead of reverting to the past, we have to build a future where we get energy from new places, use it in new ways, and do more with less.Clean coal? Natural gas? Nuclear? Electric cars? We'll need them all. When you look at the numbers, you'll find that we'll still be using fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables for decades to come. Looks at new battery technology, smart grids, passive buildings, decentralized generation, clean coal, and carbon sequestration. These are buzzwords now, but they'll be a part of your world soon. For many people, they already are.Written by the cutting edge Science Editor for Boing Boing, one of the ten most popular blogs in America\n  ...more"

With no business experience whatsoever, Boyle was faced with the challenge running Columbia, which had been founded in 1937 by her father-a Jewish immigrant who fled Hitler's Germany to come to America. Though many expected Boyle to fail, she and her son Tim persevered, and kept the business afloat through very challenging times. In 1970, Columbia Sportswear boasted forty employees and $800,000 in annual sales. Under the leadership of Gert and Tim Boyle, the company now has more than two thousand employees, annual sales approaching one billion dollars, and is the leading seller of skiwear in the United States. And thanks to a creative advertising campaign that billed her as \"one tough mother,\" Gert Boyle has become an icon in her industry, and she is the first woman ever inducted into the International Sporting Goods Hall of Fame. In ONE TOUGH MOTHER, Boyle presents and honest, open, and often irreverent account of her truly remarkable journey from a childhood in Nazi Germany to fame and fortune in America. Boyle offers insights into succeeding in business and in life, and shares many of the advertisements and strategies that have made her so recognizable. Her story is one that will inspire anyone who dreams of turning a small business into a bigger business, as well as individuals who find themselves facing circumstances beyond their control.\n  ...more"

Stuck in the land of status quo, we’ve forgotten how to think. And the very structures put in place to help businesses grow are now holding them back. It’s time to Kill the Company.\nThis book is a call to arms: to start a revolution in how we think and work. But instead of more one-size-fits-all change initiatives forced upon employees, we need to embrace smaller, positive behavioral changes that create ripple effects throughout the organization. Thinking can no longer be exclusive to the creative team or lead strategists. Rather, a culture of curiosity must be fostered among the ranks to shake up our standard practices, from unproductive meetings to go-nowhere strategic planning. This revolution can and will awaken our ability to think, and ultimately, to innovate and grow.\nIn Kill the Company, innovation specialist Lisa Bodell urges companies to shift the mindset from business as usual to the company of the future, to move from what she calls “Zombies, Inc.” to “Think, Inc.” This involves both risk and trust: to allow all employees the opportunity and environment to be curious and inquisitive—even challenging and provocative when the situation calls for it. Too often, this type of behavior is seen as threatening, says Bodell, who has actually been told by CEOs that they discourage employees from thinking. In step with the call to Kill the Company, is a plea to kill fear, complacency, and the all-too-familiar answer from our leaders: “I can’t be bothered with your (perhaps brilliant) idea.”\nBodell also looks at how we got to Zombies, Inc., exploring how our educational system contributes to the lack of inquiry and problem-solving skills, showing how conformity is rewarded early on. She also draws from the work of such education luminaries as Sir Ken Robinson and the groundbreaking Blue School (founded by members of the Blue Man Group).\nIn the end, readers of Kill the Company will have a full sense of how much riskier it is to stay here in the status quo than to break out and think.\n\n  ...more"

Being a golf fanatic, the analogies she uses make her books fun and sports-oriented, and in her latest guide, which promotes a healthy, competitive approach to achieving personal success, she tells you to visualize every shot and how you will play to win.\n\nWhat does success in life mean to you?\n\nHow will you ultimately reach your goals?\n\nIs fear, procrastination, or negativity in self-talk and thought processes holding you back?\n\nThen Myers will take you to the driving range to encourage you to practice and work hard to develop your skills while making sure you are aligned correctly to hit your target. Teaching you how to cultivate a well-honed and resilient mindset, she will then show you how to devise a flexible, measurable, well-thought-out action plan that uses solid, action-oriented strategies to track your improvements.\n\nHow you live your life is your choice, and if you find things aren’t working out, you can change midstream. There’s no need to adopt a stereotypical lifestyle or follow anyone’s example. The important thing is, what will work for you?\n\nExamine whether you are truly content and whether that contentment has enough substance to last you a lifetime. If not, embrace change, which could come in the form of opportunities. For example, in the workplace, your skills might also work well in other areas where you would feel more challenged or make quicker progress. Maybe you are drawn to a completely different profession such as journalism, law, teaching, or the performing arts, or you might be attracted to a sales and marketing position that would entail extensive travel.\n\n* * *\n\nAbout the book\n\nAt the age of twenty, Lorii Myers had a near-death experience when an allergic reaction to food additives caused her throat to swell to a point where she could no longer catch her breath. As her husband checked her into emergency, she lost consciousness and it took a shot of adrenaline to bring her around. \n\nWeeks later, she still had blister-like welts on her face, and during a follow-up appointment, she asked her doctor what would have happened if she hadn’t made it to the hospital in time. He casually explained she could have slipped into a coma, but to Myers, the mother of a one-month-old baby, “It was the most significant thing in my world-survival,” she says. At that very point, her perspective changed. She focused on what was important to her, learning how to embrace urgency and use it to her advantage. \n\nImmediately caught in what she refers to as “the make-it-happen moment,” she launched a lifestyle that was geared toward the optimization of personal achievement. “One of my favorite mottos is ad astra per aspera,” she says, “Latin for ‘To the stars, through adversity.’” \n\nIn her book, Make it Happen, the second in a series entitled 3 Off the Tee, she hopes to impart some of that spirit to her readers. \n\nThose who read her first book, Targeting Success, will already know Myers is a golf fanatic, and the golf analogies she uses in her books make them fun and sports-oriented. “I think constantly in terms of fairways and greens,” she says. “In other words, keep me on the straight and narrow and I can’t lose!” \n\nIn any type of game, healthy competition prevails when you come out to play and play to win. A challenging game like golf requires mental and physical finesse and there is a constant incentive to improve your score, your abilities, and yourself. It reminds you of the value of being consistent, in control, and relentlessly resilient, and there is a powerful sense of urgency to stay focused, make decisions, and take your best shot. Despite inevitable distractions and hazards, as in life, you must keep your head in the game. \n\n“To be good at anything, you have to want it,” says Myers. There may be times when you hit a point of transition and lust after change. Whether the change is initiated by external forces or self-induced, she advises her readers to get set in motion and to make a lunge toward whatever is missing from their lives. \n\nMyers wrote Make it Happen to help you when what you see as achievable brushes your life, when you figure out that the status quo no longer cuts it, and when you combine desire, determination, and knowledge and decide it’s time to grab hold of your dreams and run with them. She wants you to be fully prepared to pull your dreams in from the fringe, get unstuck, feel the urgency, and step up. \n\nIf you are confident that you have done the work, know what you want, and deserve that chance—why settle?\n\nMake It Happen promises a current, timely, and thought-provoking journey of self-discovery, and once you figure out what you want in life—expect nothing less.\n\nStay the course!\n  ...more"

That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home—is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.\n\nDrawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation—autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.\n  ...more"

This book offers the hidden story behind these and other questions, as economist Tim Harford ranges from Africa, Asia, Europe, and of course the United States to reveal how supermarkets, airlines, and coffee chains--to name just a few--are vacuuming money from our wallets. Harford punctures the myths surrounding some of today's biggest controversies, including the high cost of health-care; he reveals why certain environmental laws can put a smile on a landlord's face; and he explains why some industries can have high profits for innocent reasons, while in other industries something sinister is going on. Covering an array of economic concepts including scarce resources, market power, efficiency, price gouging, market failure, inside information, and game theory, Harford sheds light on how these forces shape our day-to-day lives, often without our knowing it. \n Showing us the world through the eyes of an economist, Tim Harford reveals that everyday events are intricate games of negotiations, contests of strength, and battles of wits. Written with a light touch and sly wit, The Undercover Economist turns \"the dismal science\" into a true delight.\n  ...more"

The son of Italian immigrants, Lee Iacocca rose spectacularly through the ranks of Ford Motor Company to become its president, only to be toppled eight years later in a power play that should have shattered him. But Lee Iacocca didn't get mad, he got even. He led a battle for Chrysler's survival that made his name a symbol of integrity, know-how, and guts for millions of Americans. In his classic hard-hitting style, he tells us how he changed the automobile industry in the 1960s by creating the phenomenal Mustang. He goes behind the scenes for a look at Henry Ford's reign of intimidation and manipulation. He recounts the miraculous rebirth of Chrysler from near bankruptcy to repayment of its $1.2 billion government loan so early that Washington didn't know how to cash the check.

Consultants promise results, but what kind of practices do they employ to achieve them?Written by two award-winning journalists, Dangerous Company tells the harrowing tale of a Fortune 500 company that spent $75 million on consulting contracts, only to see sales plummet from $1.3 billion to $319 million; explains how AT&T could spend half a billion dollars in consulting fees without any sign of progress; and exposes a consultant who provided government officials with information that helped send a former client to jail. You'll learn how Sears got turned around thanks to CEO Arthur Martinez's sophisticated and limited use of consultants, and how small, highly focused consulting firms are providing cost-effective, targeted advice and mounting a challenge to their larger competitors.

Stop thinking of employees as either family or as free agents. Think of them instead as allies.\n\nAs a manager you want your employees to help transform the company for the future. And your employees want the company to help transform their careers for the long term. But this win-win scenario will happen only if both sides trust each other enough to commit to mutual investment and mutual benefit. Sadly, trust in the business world is hovering at an all-time low.\n\nWe can rebuild that lost trust with straight talk that recognizes the realities of the modern economy. So, paradoxically, the alliance begins with managers acknowledging that great employees might leave the company, and with employees being honest about their own career aspirations.\n\nBy putting this new alliance at the heart of your talent management strategy, you’ll not only bring back trust, you’ll be able to recruit and retain the entrepreneurial individuals you need to adapt to a fast-changing world.\n\nThese individuals, flexible, creative, and with a bias toward action, thrive when they’re on a specific “tour of duty”—when they have a mission that’s mutually beneficial to employee and company that can be completed in a realistic period of time.\n\nCoauthored by the founder of LinkedIn, this bold but practical guide for managers and executives will give you the tools you need to recruit, manage, and retain the kind of employees who will make your company thrive in today’s world of constant innovation and fast-paced change.\n\n  ...more"

In a monumental verdict, a jury recently awarded Apple $1.05 billion dollars in damages, determining that Samsung copied the technology used on the iPhone and iPad. Christian Louboutin did not make out as well in its case against Yves St. Laurent. Despite having applied for a trademark for their brand-defining red-soled shoes, the court found that Louboutin could not impede the creativity of other designers and granted Yves St. Laurent the right to copy the well-known fashion statement. From smart phones to high heels, song lyrics to Spider-Man, possessing copyrights, patents and trademarks is the first line of self-defense, as well as highly lucrative. \n\nIn INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: Money and Power in a New Era (Thomson Reuters, September 2012) attorney Alexandre Montagu explores the pitfalls of being caught unaware of Intellectual Property law. Montagu’s clients include Fortune 500 companies and his practice encompasses a broad variety of industries such as culinary, financial services, entertainment, publishing, and cosmetics. “Whether it’s the trade secrets of a hedge fund’s algorithms, the copyrights or patents underlying the smart phone, the trademarks that protect well-known brands, intellectual property bastes the modern economy,” he says. Through fascinating anecdotes and compelling court cases, Montagu brings home just how important legal literacy can be for your business—think how different social media would be if the Winklevoss brothers had a written agreement with Mark Zuckerburg.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY fascinates with cases pulled from the evening news. Montagu provides inside access to The Da Vinci Code lawsuit when an author sued publisher Random House for stealing his previously published plot for the best-selling novel. Montagu explains why the case was dismissed, even though there are blatant similarities between the two books. Compelling stories and legal insight make this book essential for songwriters, CEOs, Web designers, inventors, restaurateurs, and anyone who’s ever signed a legal document without reading all of the fine print.\n  ...more"

It’s about finding the sweet spot in life where you can hold both success and doubt in a way that feels meaningful, actionable and spacious — versus stressful, stuck and painful. The book was born out of Stacey's own story and the stories of many of her coaching clients who struggle and continually work to tame their inner critics. \n\nSome of us wrestle with the Comparer, others of us struggle with feeling like a Fraud, while others face off against the Perfectionist. Stacey has found that many successful people bump up against these worthy adversaries, no matter how they are defined. This book does not promise to rid you of your inner critics and doubts. Rather, shockingly, it asks you to dive right into the center of them in order to find valuable insights you can USE. In the end, your critics hold far less energy and YOU are in the driver’s seat, as you pursue What Really Matters. Inner Critic Inner Success challenges you to define success in a radical new way — on YOUR terms (versus what society, culture and business dictates) and from the perspective of how you FEEL about success (not just how you THINK).\n\nIt’s also a business book that bucks the trend by making emotions part of the conversation. Yes, emotions. The other part of your big, beautiful intelligent brain — equally as powerful and potent yet often overlooked and under-utilized, pushed off to the side and labeled “invalid.” \n\nIn this book, Stacey walks you through her coaching process offering insights, activities and real world application of it all. She helps you build your emotional intelligence and capacity, tame and use those inner critics for the powers of good, and sets you in the direction of determining your own success, with meaning and confidence. As your coach, she is 100% in your corner and rooting for you!\n  ...more"

Il est incontestable qu’il faut toujours apprendre même en provenance de vos concurrents.

Suppose the better—and smarter—solution is simply to remain small? This book explains how to do just that.\n\nCompany of One is a refreshingly new approach centered on staying small and avoiding growth, for any size business. Not as a freelancer who only gets paid on a per piece basis, and not as an entrepreneurial start-up that wants to scale as soon as possible, but as a small business that is deliberately committed to staying that way. By staying small, one can have freedom to pursue more meaningful pleasures in life, and avoid the headaches that result from dealing with employees, long meetings, or worrying about expansion. Company of One introduces this unique business strategy and explains how to make it work for you, including how to generate cash flow on an ongoing basis.\n\n Paul Jarvis left the corporate world when he realized that working in a high-pressure, high profile world was not his idea of success. Instead, he now works for himself out of his home on a small, lush island off of Vancouver, and lives a much more rewarding and productive life. He no longer has to contend with an environment that constantly demands more productivity, more output, and more growth.\n  \n In Company of One, Jarvis explains how you can find the right pathway to do the same, including planning how to set up your shop, determining your desired revenues, dealing with unexpected crises, keeping your key clients happy, and of course, doing all of this on your own.\n  ...more"

After many years of working with Apple, Adobe, HP, and many other companies, Nilofer Merchant discovered the secret sauce: the best way to create a winning strategy is to include employees at all levels, helping to create strategy they not only believe in, but are also equipped to implement.\n\nIn The New How, Nilofer shows today's corporate directors, executives, and managers how they can transform their traditional, top-down approach to strategy planning and execution into collaborative \"stratecution\" that has proven to be significantly more effective.\n\n\nEnhance performance and outcomes by deflating the \"air sandwich\" between executives in the boardroom and employees\nRecognize that strategy and execution are thoroughly intertwined\nUnderstand how successful strategy is founded in effective idea selection-a pile of good ideas doesn't necessarily build good strategy\nCreate company strategy and link it to targeted execution, using the practical models and techniques provided\n  ...more"

So how can you get there?\n\nYou Must First Recognize that Behaviors Determine Your Values, and That Values Should Drive Your Workplace Behaviors\nTake a journey with acclaimed leader Robert \"Bo\" Brabo back through a storied career -- to his years on the military battlefield, to a decade in the White House as a Presidential Communications Officer for President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, and to his experiences as a corporate executive and a small business owner -- to learn from real, raw, front-row stories about values-based leadership.\n\nFrom the Battlefield to the White House to the Boardroom is a leadership memoir chock-full of practical lessons and inspiring case studies to help leaders and aspiring leaders develop, embrace, and strengthen a values-based approach to leading people, projects, and organizations.\n\nA must-read for:\n\n-- C-suite executives\n-- Military leaders\n-- Corporate, not-for-profit and government leaders\n-- Small business owners\n-- Aspiring and rising leaders\n-- Business school (MBA) students\n\nValues Are Deeply Personal, So Can They Be Shared Among Thousands of Workers or More? Yes!\nBo Brabo first learned to lead (and, before that, to follow the lead of great leaders) in the Army, an organization that espouses the following \"LDRSHIP\" values:\n\n-- Loyalty\n-- Duty\n-- Respect\n-- Selfless Service\n-- Honor\n-- Integrity\n-- Personal Courage\n\nThe Army employs more than 1.3 million people (Active, Reserve, National Guard, and Civilians). Expand that to include the entire Department of Defense and it's well over two million strong. So how does an organization with more than a million people live by, exemplify, and maintain a strong values system? How does generation after generation of Soldiers continue to carry out the nation's defense both at home and abroad? They behave in alignment with the Army's values, every day and in every way.\n\nAnd the truth is that whatever your organizational values may be -- perhaps they are boldness, truth, accountability, and commitment to customers -- the lessons Bo Brabo learned on the battlefield, in the White House, and in the boardroom can be applied to your everyday work and long-term aspirations. Behave in alignment with the right values, then inspire others to do the same, and anything is possible.\n\nFocus on the People\nThroughout his life and career, Bo Brabo has always focused on the people, helping them tackle their problems as if they were his own. This book challenges you to focus on the people, behave in alignment with core organizational values, and think about your work in fresh new ways.\n\nLearn how organizations can demonstrate consistent behaviors over time to reflect the values that -- when extrapolated across all employees -- create the right culture and the best results.\n\nFrom the Battlefield to the White House to the Boardroom helps you establish, build upon, and see value in leading your own team or company to a strong values-based system that, in turn, leads to desired outcomes and an organizational culture worthy of emulation. It's time to get down to business\n\nWith a foreword by Mike Barger, Former Chief Instructor, US Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN); Co-founder, JetBlue Airways.\n  ...more"

Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultra of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.\n\nBut Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, different.\n\nKnight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.\n  ...more"

How do you create change when you have few resources and no title or authority to back you up? Chip and Dan Heath, the best-selling authors of Made to Stick, are back with a ground-breaking book that addresses one of the greatest challenges of our personal and professional lives — how to change things when change is hard.\n\nIn their follow-up book to the critically acclaimed international bestseller Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath talk about how difficult change is in our companies, our careers, and our lives, why change is so hard, and how we can overcome our resistance and make change happen. The Heaths liken the human mind to two distinct entities — the animal mind, or what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls the elephant, and the logical brain, which Haidt describes as the rider. The elephant is instinctive; it acts on emotion. It likes gorging on Oreos and sleeping in. And it loves routines — doing things the same old way, every day.\n\nThe rider is the planner and thinker. The rider obsesses about the future. He or she wants to stop eating junk food and stop hitting the snooze button. But it’s hard, because when the rider and elephant disagree on where to go, the rider usually loses. And that describes the essential tension between our primitive emotional brain and our high intellect, and helps to explain why changing how we behave is so difficult. The secret to making a switch is understanding this odd couple relationship. Direct the Rider. Motivate the Elephant. Shape the Path.\n\nThroughout Switch, Chip and Dan Heath illustrate and explain situations in which sweeping change was adopted, from a university researcher who ended the cycle of child abuse in a group of families, to an entrepreneur who turned his skeptical employees into customer service zealots and saved his company. \n\nIn the tradition of Made to Stick, Blink, and Outliers, Switch is filled with engaging and entertaining stories of how companies and individuals have brought about and sustained significant change. An indispensable guide to making change happen, it is certain to become a classic.\n  ...more"

Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years—as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues—Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.\n  ...more"

As the cofounder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group -- one of the fastest growing media companies in the world -- celebrated as one of the world's most influential women, and gracing the covers of magazines, she was, by any traditional measure, extraordinarily successful. Yet as she found herself going from brain MRI to CAT scan to echocardiogram, to find out if there was any underlying medical problem beyond exhaustion, she wondered is this really what success feels like?\n \nAs more and more people are coming to realize, there is far more to living a truly successful life than just earning a bigger salary and capturing a corner office. Our relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of success -- money and power -- has led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses, and an erosion in the quality of our relationships, family life, and, ironically, our careers. In being connected to the world 24/7, we're losing our connection to what truly matters. Our current definition of success is, as Thrive shows, literally killing us. We need a new way forward.\n \nIn a commencement address Arianna gave at Smith College in the spring of 2013, she likened our drive for money and power to two legs of a three-legged stool. They may hold us up temporarily, but sooner or later we're going to topple over. We need a third leg -- a third metric for defining success -- to truly thrive. That third metric, she writes in Thrive, includes our well-being, our ability to draw on our intuition and inner wisdom, our sense of wonder, and our capacity for compassion and giving. As Arianna points out, our eulogies celebrate our lives very differently from the way society defines success. They don't commemorate our long hours in the office, our promotions, or our sterling PowerPoint presentations as we relentlessly raced to climb up the career ladder. They are not about our resumes -- they are about cherished memories, shared adventures, small kindnesses and acts of generosity, lifelong passions, and the things that made us laugh.\n \nIn this deeply personal book, Arianna talks candidly about her own challenges with managing time and prioritizing the demands of a career and raising two daughters -- of juggling business deadlines and family crises, a harried dance that led to her collapse and to her \"aha moment.\" Drawing on the latest groundbreaking research and scientific findings in the fields of psychology, sports, sleep, and physiology that show the profound and transformative effects of meditation, mindfulness, unplugging, and giving, Arianna shows us the way to a revolution in our culture, our thinking, our workplace, and our lives.\n  ...more"

He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.\n\nManson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.\n\nThere are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.\n  ...more"

And what does it mean to you and your children?\n\nThe answer lies in a landmark Stanford University study. Children were left in a room, each with a marshmallow, and given the choice of eating it then or fifteen minutes later, when they were promised an extra marshmallow as a reward for waiting. Some ate theirs right away. Others waited. But the study's real significance came a decade later when the researchers discovered that the children who held out for the reward had become more successful adults than the children who gobbled their marshmallows immediately.\n\nThe lesson wasn't lost on Joachim de Posada, a world-renowned motivational speaker to thousands of corporate executives and professional athletes. The \"marshmallow theory\" answered a thirty-year quest to find a compelling explanation for why some people succeed and others fail. Posada was convinced that the key difference between success and failure is not merely hard work or superior intelligence but the ability to delay gratification. \"Marshmallow resisters\" achieve high levels of success while the rest of us eat all our marshmallows at once, so to speak--accumulating debt and dissatisfaction no matter what our occupations or incomes. But it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nUsing a simple parable and real-life examples (including basketball great Larry Bird and major league baseball catcher Jorge Posada, Joachim's cousin), this book shows you how the moves you make today can pay off big tomorrow--if you just don't eat the marshmallow...yet!\n  ...more"

Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, reveals a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency efforts can slow a company down. That principle is the value of slack, the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change. Implementing slack could be as simple as adding an assistant to a department and letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photocopier and more time making key decisions, or it could mean designing workloads that allow people room to think, innovate, and reinvent themselves. It means embracing risk, eliminating fear, and knowing when to go slow. Slack allows for change, fosters creativity, promotes quality, and, above all, produces growth. \n\nWith an approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook debunks commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and gives you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness.\n  ...more"

Hundreds of billions of dollars change hands in the stock market on a daily basis. With this huge amount of money moving around daily, the average investor never becomes rich in the stock market. Why is this?\n\nAverage investors do not become rich because they do not know how to apply psychology and business acumen to investment decisions. Instead they attempt to mimic the behaviors of successful investors such as Warren Buffett, George Soros, and Carl Icahn in a desperate bid to achieve half their success. Millions of investors mimic these strategies and still do not become rich.\n\nThis fact applies universally – even the most successful psychologists, corporate executives, statisticians, and finance professors cannot seem to leverage their knowledge to succeed in the market.\n\nDoes this mean that it is impossible to become rich in the stock market? Of course not; it is very possible to become rich in the market. The distinguishing difference between the average investor and the successful investor is a history of consistent, insightful trading.\n\nBecoming better than the average investor means seeking out knowledge that the average investor does not have. Nearly all investment books are devoid of this prized knowledge – which is why the average investor, reading the average investment book, never acquires sufficient insight to succeed in the market.\n\n“The Stock Market Outsider: Becoming a Billionaire” ventures into a realm beyond that of the average investment book. It provides an interesting, practical approach to succeeding in the market using psychology and business acumen to drive investment decisions. The book focuses on the core principle of stock market success – investing in businesses that are most likely to increase in value and understanding when to enter and exit positions. It disregards the unnecessarily complex and risky trading strategies that many traders use to their own doom – strategies that are closer to gambling than true investing.\n\nThe author, Philip Fanara, is a Certified Internal Auditor with a career broadly spanning over multiple business areas. He is an avid data miner, possessing over 10 years of investment experience, an M.B.A. from Louisiana State University, and is certified in Risk Management Assurance. \"The Stock Market Outsider: Becoming a Billionaire\" is the culmination of his years of experience, education, and research on business and investments. The strategy detailed throughout the book was developed after devoting a year to intensely analyzing market data, psychology, and his past trading successes and failures.\n  ...more"

It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies.\" So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time.\n\nDrawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\"\n\nWhat separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked?\n\nBy answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.\n\nFilled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.\n  ...more"

Making profits through immoral means--such as deceiving investors or customers--is unsustainable. Likewise, remaining moral while losing money will cause a business to fail. According to conventional morality, either a business manager maximizes profits and necessarily compromises on ethics, or necessarily sacrifices profits in order to be moral. Woiceshyn explains why this is a false dichotomy and offers rational egoism as an alternative moral code to businesspeople who want to maximize profits ethically. Through logical argument and various examples, this book shows how to apply principles such as rationality, productiveness, honesty, justice, and pride for long-term self-interest.\n  ...more"

This guidance is tangible and applicable. We all understand that attributes like trust and passion are important, but it is vital that the Seven Attributes focus on those areas where you have total control. Trust is the first word of successful relationship. It is the heart of what we endeavor to provide, but it is only achievable when we get the job done and our clients enjoy our relationship. Some preliminary assumptions regarding these Attributes include: -Defining a manageable number of attributes that matter most. -A focus on the day-to day experience working with the vendor. -Assessment of the maturity of the development vendor s operations. -Consideration of fulfilling the global promise presented during sales. -Treating the vendors fairly; not applying an unrealistic benchmark. -Balancing objectives based on quality and performance; not just size or cost. So, what are the Seven Attributes? In very simple terms and in order of importance, the Seven Attributes are: 1. Experience 2. Methodology 3. Infrastructure 4. Process 5. Technology 6. Talent 7.

We all hope that these aspects of our life will be a source of fulfillment and pleasure, and they often are. Yet they are also always sources of problems for which we seek practical advice and solutions. The best prescription, according to Chögyam Trungpa, is a dose of reality and also a dose of respect for ourselves and our world. His profound teachings on work, sex, and money celebrate the sacredness of life and our ability to cope with its twists and turns with dignity, humor, and even joy. \n\nHe begins by breaking down the barrier between the spiritual and the mundane, showing that work, sex, and money are just as much a part of our spiritual life as they are a part of our everyday existence. He then discusses these subjects in relation to ego and self-image, karma, mindfulness, and meditation. “Work” includes general principles of mindfulness and awareness in how we conduct everyday life as well as discussion of ethics in business and the workplace. “Sex” is about relationships and communication as a whole. “Money” looks at how we view the economics of livelihood and money as “green energy” that affects our lives. The result is an inclusive vision of life, one that encompasses the biggest issues and the smallest details of every day. \n\nThere are, in fact, few definitive answers in these pages. There is, however, authentic wisdom providing us with tools we need to work with the toughest stuff in our lives.\n  ...more"

Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.\n\nIn the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.\n\nBlue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.\n  ...more"

Through his unique five-dimensional management process and system called Market-Based Management. Based on five decades of cross-disciplinary studies, experimental discovery, and practical implementation across Koch companies and their 100,000 employees worldwide, the core objective of Market-Based Management's framework is as simple as it is effective: to generate good profit.\n\nWhat is good profit? Good profit results when a company creates value for customers in a way that helps them improve their lives. Good profit is the result of innovations that customers freely vote for with their own dollars; it's the result of business decisions that create long term value for everyone--customers, employees, shareholders, and society.\n\nWhile you won't find the Koch Industries name on your home's stain-resistant carpet, your baby's more comfortable but absorbent diapers your stretch denim jeans, or your television with a better clarity screen, MBM(TM) drove these innovations and many more.\n\nHere, drawing on revealing, honest stories from his five decades in business - the company's many successes as well as its stumbles - Koch walks the reader step-by-step through the five dimensions of Market-Based Management to show stockholders, entrepreneurs, leaders, students -- and innovators, supervisors and employees of all kinds, in any field --how to apply the principles to generate Good Profit in their organizations, companies, and lives.\n\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\n  ...more"

Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?\n\nPeople like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers might have little in common, but they all started with why. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.\n\nIn studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way—and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be lead, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.\n\nAny organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why. WHY is not money or profit—those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders, but not others?\n\nStarting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.\n\nDrawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire.

Amy Edmondson shows that organizations thrive, or fail to thrive, based on how well the small groups within those organizations work. In most organizations, the work that produces value for customers is carried out by teams, and increasingly, by flexible team-like entities. The pace of change and the fluidity of most work structures means that it's not really about creating effective teams anymore, but instead about leading effective teaming. Teaming shows that organizations learn when the flexible, fluid collaborations they encompass are able to learn. The problem is teams, and other dynamic groups, don't learn naturally. Edmondson outlines the factors that prevent them from doing so, such as interpersonal fear, irrational beliefs about failure, groupthink, problematic power dynamics, and information hoarding. With Teaming, leaders can shape these factors by encouraging reflection, creating psychological safety, and overcoming defensive interpersonal dynamics that inhibit the sharing of ideas. Further, they can use practical management strategies to help organizations realize the benefits inherent in both success and failure. * Presents a clear explanation of practical management concepts for increasing learning capability for business results * Introduces a framework that clarifies how learning processes must be altered for different kinds of work * Explains how Collaborative Learning works, and gives tips for how to do it well * Includes case-study research on Intermountain healthcare, Prudential, GM, Toyota, IDEO, the IRS, and both Cincinnati and Minneapolis Children's Hospitals, among others Based on years of research, this book shows how leaders can make organizational learning happen by building t\n  ...more"

Young founders leave college with a big idea, get to work in a garage, and build something that changes the world. Typical corporate employees, strangled by slow-moving bureaucracy, are blocked from making transformative discoveries.\n\nIn Driving Innovation from Within, strategist and advisor Kaihan Krippendorff disproves one of today’s biggest business myths to highlight the lessons for innovators and leaders. He reveals how most of the modern world’s most impactful creations were invented by passionate employee-innovators. If it were left up to go-it-alone entrepreneurs, we would not have mobile phones, personal computers, or email. Distilling over 150 interviews with internal innovators and leading experts along with insights from the latest research and today’s most successful companies, from Tencent and Amazon to Mastercard and Starbucks, Krippendorff lays out a step-by-step playbook to unlock innovation from the inside. He maps the barriers that frustrate efforts to disrupt from within and provides tools to remove them, detailing how visionary leaders can create islands of freedom inside an organization to activate existing employees’ potential and beat startups at their own game.

And what he suggests is both simple and revolutionary.\n\nCasey McDaniel, the founder and CEO of Yip Software, is in the midst of a problem he created, but one he doesn't know how to solve. And he doesn't know where or who to turn to for advice. His staff can't help him; they're as dumbfounded as he is by their tortuous meetings.\n\nThen an unlikely advisor, Will Peterson, enters Casey's world. When he proposes an unconventional, even radical, approach to solving the meeting problem, Casey is just desperate enough to listen.\n\nAs in his other books, Lencioni provides a framework for his groundbreaking model, and makes it applicable to the real world. \"Death by Meeting\" is nothing short of a blueprint for leaders who want to eliminate waste and frustration among their teams, and create environments of engagement and passion.\n  ...more"

How do these individuals make the split-second decisions that save lives? Most studies of decision making, based on artificial tasks assigned in laboratory settings, view people as biased and unskilled. Gary Klein is one of the developers of the naturalistic decision making approach, which views people as inherently skilled and experienced. It documents human strengths and capabilities that so far have been downplayed or ignored.\n\nSince 1985, Klein has conducted fieldwork to find out how people tackle challenges in difficult, nonroutine situations. Sources of Power is based on observations of humans acting under such real-life constraints as time pressure, high stakes, personal responsibility, and shifting conditions. The professionals studied include firefighters, critical care nurses, pilots, nuclear power plant operators, battle planners, and chess masters. Each chapter builds on key incidents and examples to make the description of the methodology and phenomena more vivid. In addition to providing information that can be used by professionals in management, psychology, engineering, and other fields, the book presents an overview of the research approach of naturalistic decision making and expands our knowledge of the strengths people bring to difficult tasks.\n  ...more"

Those beliefs have inspired expensive attempts to shield employees from change, involve them in high-level decision-making, and keep them happy with endless “satisfaction surveys” and workplace perks. But what these engagement programs actually do, Cy Wakeman says, is inflate expectations and sow unhappiness, leaving employees unprepared to adapt to even minor changes necessary to the organization’s survival. Rather than driving performance and creating efficiencies, these programs fuel entitlement and drama, costing millions in time and profit.\n\nIt is high time to reinvent leadership thinking. Stop worrying about your employees’ happiness, and start worrying about their accountability. Cy Wakeman teaches you how to hire “emotionally inexpensive” people, solicit only the opinions you need, and promote self-awareness in your whole team. No Ego disposes with unproven HR maxims, and instead offers a complete plan to turn your office from a den of discontent to a happy, productive place.\n  ...more"

What’s below the waterline? What’s deep inside the best leaders that makes them different?\n\nMark Miller contends it is their leadership character. In his latest enlightening and entertaining business fable, he describes the five unique character traits exhibited by exceptional leaders and how to cultivate them.\n\nThe Heart of Leadership begins with young and ambitious Blake Brown being passed over for a desperately wanted promotion, despite an outstanding individual performance. Confused and frustrated, he turns to his former mentor, Debbie Brewster. Rather than attempting to solve Blake’s problem for him, she sends him on a quest to meet with five of his late father’s colleagues, each of whom holds a piece of the puzzle he’s trying to solve.\n\nAs Blake puts the pieces together, he discovers that in the final analysis, a lack of skills isn’t what holds most leaders back; skills are too easy to learn. Without demonstrated leadership character, however, a skill set will never be enough. Most often, when leaders fail to reach their full potential, it is an issue of the heart. This is Blake’s ultimate revelation.\n\nThis book shows us that leadership needn’t be the purview of the few—it is within reach for millions around the world. The Heart of Leadership is a road map for every person who desires to make a difference in the lives of others and become a leader people want to follow.\n  ...more"

But they ended up in an epic feud with brothers Bill and Frederick that spanned nearly two decades, tearing the family apart--and nearly Koch Industries along with it. Bill would start his own energy company and attain a modicum of fame as a litigious wine collector and yachtsman. After being marginalized by the patriarch because of his effete manner, Frederick became a patron of the arts and a fastidious refurbisher of historic estates.Starting with their boyhood when fraternal disputes were sometimes settled in the boxing ring, Sons of Wichita takes you inside this highly private family and traces the evolution of these four distinct personalities, as well as their corporate, philosophical, social, and political ambitions. Influenced by the conservative, anticommunist sentiments of their father, a founding member of the John Birch Society, Charles and David devised an ambitious strategy to foist their ideological agenda upon the nation--quietly channeling millions of dollars of their fortune into a web of free market think tanks, academic programs, advocacy groups, and more, while also building what amounts to a shadow Republican Party, replete with a donor network capable of raising as much in an election cycle as the Republican National Committee. Never before did they flex their political muscles as vigorously as they did during the 2012 campaign, when Charles and David clashed with the Obama administration in what Charles described as the \"mother of all wars.\"Like the Rockefellers before them, the Koch brothers are a great American dynasty. Unlike the Rockefellers, they have never before been the subject of a major biography.\n  ...more"

In the spirit of a sympathetic teacher, Robert Kegan guides us through this tricky curriculum, assessing the fit between its complex demands and our mental capacities, and showing what happens when we find ourselves, as we so often do, in over our heads. In this dazzling intellectual tour, he completely reintroduces us to the psychological landscape of our private and public lives. A decade ago in The Evolving Self, Kegan presented a dynamic view of the development of human consciousness. Here he applies this widely acclaimed theory to the mental complexity of adulthood. As parents and partners, employees and bosses, citizens and leaders, we constantly confront a bewildering array of expectations, prescriptions, claims, and demands, as well as an equally confusing assortment of expert opinions that tell us what each of these roles entails. Surveying the disparate expert \"literatures, \" which normally take no account of each other, Kegan brings them together to reveal, for the first time, what these many demands have in common. Our frequent frustration in trying to meet these complex and often conflicting claims results, he shows us, from a mismatch between the way we ordinarily know the world and the way we are unwittingly expected to understand it. In Over Our Heads provides us entirely fresh perspectives on a number of cultural controversies - the \"abstinence vs. safe sex\" debate, the diversity movement, communication across genders, the meaning of postmodernism. What emerges in these pages is a theory of evolving ways of knowing that allows usto view adult development much as we view child development, as an open-ended process born of the dynamic interaction of cultural demands and emerging mental capabilities. If our culture is to be a good \"school, \" as Kegan suggests, it must offer, along with a challenging curriculu\n  ...more"

Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.\n\nPiketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality—the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth—today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, Piketty says, and may do so again.\n\nA work of extraordinary ambition, originality, and rigor, Capital in the Twenty-First Century reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.\n  ...more"

We arrive at his central investment methodology of Austrian Investing, where victory comes not from waging the immediate decisive battle, but rather from the roundabout approach of seeking the intermediate positional advantage (what he calls shi), of aiming at the indirect means rather than directly at the ends. The monumental challenge is in seeing time differently, in a whole new intertemporal dimension, one that is so contrary to our wiring.\n\nSpitznagel is the first to condense the theories of Ludwig von Mises and his Austrian School of economics into a cohesive and--as Spitznagel has shown--highly effective investment methodology. From identifying the monetary distortions and non-randomness of stock market routs (Spitznagel's bread and butter) to scorned highly-productive assets, in Ron Paul's words from the foreword, Spitznagel \"brings Austrian economics from the ivory tower to the investment portfolio.\"\n\nThe Dao of Capital provides a rare and accessible look through the lens of one of today's great investors to discover a profound harmony with the market process--a harmony that is so essential today.\n  ...more"

In Beyond Performance,  McKinsey & Company's Scott Keller and Colin Price give you everything you need to build an organization that can execute in the short run and has the vitality to prosper over the long term.\n\nDrawing on the most exhaustive research effort of its kind on organizational effectiveness and change management, Keller and Price put hard science behind their big idea: that the health of an organization is equally as important as its performance. In the book's foreword, management guru Gary Hamel refers to this notion as \"a new manifesto for thinking about organizations.\"\n\nThe authors illustrate why copying management best practices from other companies is more dangerous than helpful Clearly explains how to determine the mutually reinforcing combination of management practices that best fits your organization's context Provides practical tools to achieve superior levels of performance and health through a staged change process: aspire, assess, architect, act, and advance. Among these are new techniques for dealing with those aspects of human behavior that are seemingly irrational (and therefore confound even the smartest leaders), yet entirely predictable Ultimately, building a healthy organization is an intangible asset that competitors copy at their peril and that enables you to skillfully adapt to and shape your environment faster than others--giving you the ultimate competitive advantage.\n  ...more"

A financier, adventurer, and philanthropist, in his debut book, RISK: Living on the Edge, he delivers intriguing insider details on how “impossible” deals are completed, along with an inspiring guide to applying risk-taking successfully to your business and personal life.\n\nTennenbaum takes us behind the scenes at Bear Stearns, illuminating the end of that great American success story as never before disclosed. He imparts insights from investment banking, risk arbitrage, and options; how he employed risk to achieve competitive advantage after leaving Bear Stearns and starting his own firms; the inner machinations of his high-stakes deals; and the backstory to innovations he created.\n\nA daredevil who feeds sharks and swims with humpback whales, who has lifted off from an aircraft carrier, descended in a nuclear submarine, trained with the Navy SEALs, and taken the Olympic bobsled run in Innsbruck, and driven an elephant in the Mekong River, Tennenbaum describes his theory of risk as the compelling force of some people’s lives, and the trait that drives visionary pioneers toward their unending accomplishments.\n\nHe shares strategies on applying boldness and challenging the status quo to seize opportunities, face struggles that pay off, manage mistakes, and give back to one’s community. Reading RISK, you get to walk in the shoes of an unpredictable, very successful self-made man who follows his own path. Applying personal tales of pushing limits and his experiences with Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the Smithsonian Institution, Harvard Business School, and the Joffrey Ballet, among other firms and cultural institutions, he demonstrates how to reach greater heights of performance, achievement, and contentment.\n\nRISK is a fascinating look at financial industry management, non-profits and how to help them grow, civic projects and how to combat inertia, and one man’s craving to move the needle of social progress.\n  ...more"

Under such pressure to stay alive—let alone grow—it’s easy for entrepreneurs to get caught up in a never-ending cycle of “sell it—do it, sell it—do it” that leaves them exhausted, frustrated, and unable to get ahead no matter how hard they try.\n\nThis is the exact situation Mike Michalowicz found himself in when he was trying to grow his first company. Although it was making steady money, there was never very much left over and he was chasing customers left and right, putting in twenty-eight-hour days, eight days a week. The punishing grind never let up. His company was alive but stunted, and he was barely breathing. That’s when he discovered an unlikely source of inspiration—pumpkin farmers.\n\nAfter reading an article about a local farmer who had dedicated his life to growing giant pump­kins, Michalowicz realized the same process could apply to growing a business. He tested the Pumpkin Plan on his own company and transformed it into a remarkable, multimillion-dollar industry leader. First he did it for himself. Then for others. And now you. So what is the Pumpkin Plan?\n\nPlant the right seeds: Don’t waste time doing a bunch of different things just to please your customers. Instead, identify the thing you do better than anyone else and focus all of your attention, money, and time on figuring out how to grow your company doing it. Weed out the losers: In a pumpkin patch small, rotten pumpkins stunt the growth of the robust, healthy ones. The same is true of customers. Figure out which customers add the most value and provide the best opportunities for sustained growth. Then ditch the worst of the worst. Nurture the winners: Once you figure out who your best customers are, blow their minds with care. Discover their unfulfilled needs, innovate to make their wishes come true, and overdeliver on every single promise.\n\nFull of stories of other successful entrepreneurs, The Pumpkin Plan guides you through unconven­tional strategies to help you build a truly profitable blue-ribbon company that is the best in its field.\n  ...more"

Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, and WALL-E, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.\n  \n As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:\n  \n • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.\n • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. \n • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.\n • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. \n • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.\n • Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.\n  ...more"

Using everyday terms and readily grasped concepts, Dr. Anthony M. Criniti IV, a former financial consultant and current university-level finance professor, sets out to detail the necessity of finance; to clarify the definition, purpose, and goals of both finance and economics; to explore financial concepts in a straightforward manner; and to stimulate interest and understanding that will lead to ongoing investigation. Finance, although highly interrelated with many subjects, is a separate field of study often confused with other areas, most notably economics. With world wealth accumulating to its highest point in history, the necessity to understand this subject on its own terms is crucial. The Necessity of Finance highlights the need to engage with finance as a separate science, clears up the confusion with related subjects, and coins the word \"financialists\" to identify the scientists in this dynamic field. Equipping the beginner to intermediate level financial student with vital information and a clear approach for continued study, its unique perspective will also be of value to the advanced student and the practitioner. Topics include: What is the difference between money and wealth? What is risk and return? What kinds of investments exist? What are the different techniques for selecting investments? What role does ethics play in finance? While The Necessity of Finance does not replace required textbooks, it is an indispensible supplemental learning tool that may clarify expectations of future financial journeys, whether in a university or in the marketplace. In this extremely useful overview, Dr. Criniti demonstrates that finance is a very promising science that will benefit those who commit themselves to its study and practice.\n  ...more"

Legal standards require employee medical and mental surveillance but also restrict assessment and intervention. As a result, an employer's course of action is both ambiguous and perilous.\n\nPart of the process to protect the organization, the Fitness for Duty (FFD) Evaluation affirms the organization's commitment to intervening responsibly when a worker's mental impairment appears likely to bring harm to the organization. Indeed, the FFD may well be the employer's single most valuable legal protection. However, there are few standards and guidelines to follow in performing FFD Evaluations-also called Independent Medical Examinations (IME)-and no specific training available.\n\nFitness For Duty: Principles, Methods, and Legal Issues offers a remedy by explaining how to apply forensic psychology to these cases-from every perspective. The author shows clinical psychologists how to do the evaluation, report the results, and support the results in the courtroom. He outlines the steps a human resources professional must follow to make the preliminary decision to obtain an FFD evaluation, what to expect, and what to do with the results. He also provides varied case studies that highlight a broad range of FFD issues in a wide variety of fields, including aviation, law enforcement, medicine, and non-safety related organizations; a specific chapter on employer liability vs. worker's rights; and advice on how to deal with legal issues. He carefully details broad standards and methods that can be applied to all blue and white collar fields.\n\nEmployers, mental health providers, employee assistance professionals, security providers, human resources workers, and the legal community all factor into risk management, each with a different outlook. With so many things at stake-the reputation of the business, the safety of the workers, the legal and economic well-being of the organization-Fitness For Duty gives you the structure you need to coordinate these positions and make better risk management decisions.\n  ...more"

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt\n\nEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.\n\nIn Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection.

Robinson and Schroeder make a bold claim that the quality of a company's output is directly related to a business measure that few companies track or understand: the ideas of employees. Ironically, the authors show that most managers and organizations are better at suppressing ideas than encouraging them. Many well-managed companies would pride themselves if they implemented one or two ideas per employee each year on the frontline. Yet high-performing idea-driven companies may implement 50 to 100 or more ideas per employee per year--and they keep count, too. In fact, Robinson and Schroeder show that idea-driven organizations are relatively rare, despite their competitive advantages.\n\nThe fundamental block to high-quality idea systems is leadership. Ideas are entirely voluntary, and employees won't generate or support them if they're misled. More than this, employees can't implement ideas if they need to seek approval at upper levels for simple improvements they understand better than their bosses. In organizations where ideas are brought to the core of strategy, systems, and management, the effect is electric. Employees are more engaged, productive, and creative. Businesses become more innovative and resilient with only minimal management inputs. The authors predict that idea-driven organizations will become the rule rather than exception. This book offers the complete guide to designing and leading this organization of the future.\n  ...more"

This approach naturally explains the ongoing internal and external organisational processes and optimum configuration of different organisations. Organisations are live creatures which are breathing, functioning, moving and developing inside their specific environments. Biological examples offer a useful way of making sense of complex ideas, because they can be related to everyday existence. As such, this allows the reader to intuitively understand the organisations where they work and with which they interact.\n\nBy classifying different types of organisations and looking at their biological functions, Organisational Anatomy links existing theories and discusses five archetypes of organisations, namely producers, knowledge-dependent, location-dependent, donor-dependent and state-affiliated organisations. By looking into their specific features, the characteristics of organisations of different ages and levels of maturity, the access and utilisation of resources, and the development of productive external relations, this book allows insights into the role of each function in achieving superior business performance. \n\nThe Organisational Anatomy approach allows the development of a holistic picture, and will allow businesses to achieve higher performance and recognise problems and difficulties by considering organisational pathologies and diseases.\n  ...more"

However, many groups have floundered in their practice-oriented adoptions. Why? Because without a deeper understanding of the thinking tools and profound organizational redesign needed, it is as though casting seeds on to an infertile field. Now, drawing on their long experience leading and guiding large-scale lean and agile adoptions for large, multisite, and offshore product development, and drawing on the best research for great team-based agile organizations, internationally recognized consultant and best-selling author Craig Larman and former leader of the agile transformation at Nokia Networks Bas Vodde share the key thinking and organizational tools needed to plant the seeds of product development success in a fertile lean and agile enterprise. Coverage includes Lean thinking and development combined with agile practices and methods Systems thinking Queuing theory and large-scale development processes Moving from single-function and component teams to stable cross-functional cross-component Scrum feature teams with end-to-end responsibility for features Organizational redesign to a lean and agile enterprise that delivers value fast Large-scale Scrum for multi-hundred-person product groups In a competitive environment that demands ever-faster cycle times and greater innovation, applied lean thinking and agile principles are becoming an urgent priority.   Scaling Lean & Agile Development   will help leaders create the foundation for their lean enterprise-and deliver on the significant benefits of agility.

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.\n\nThese may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.\n\nThrough forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nWhat unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.\n\nFreakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.\n(front flap)\n  ...more"

He argues that Musk is an amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy\n  ...more"

This unique book--part manifesto from a leader, part humorous activist memoir from a soccer mom--offers a wryly honest, behind the scenes, ultimately uplifting look at the state of the planet. For almost 20 years, Tzeporah Berman has been one of our most influential environmentalists. A founder of ForestEthics and PowerUp Canada, she was instrumental in shaping the tactics and concerns of the modern environmental movement. \n\nIn her early 20s she faced nearly one thousand criminal charges and 6 years in prison for her role organizing blockades in Canada's rainforest. With ForestEthics she took on Victoria's Secret with a photo of a chainsaw-wielding lingerie model, convincing the catalogue manufacturer to stop using paper made from old-growth forests. She then transformed her tactics and sat down with CEOs and political leaders to reshape their policies and practices. She participated in saving over 12 million acres of endangered forests, including Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, and has campaigned against the development of Canada's oil sands. In her new role at Greenpeace International she is fighting the problem of our time: climate change, including researching the impacts of the Gulf Oil Spill and protesting oil drilling in the Arctic. As a concerned mother, her book is an impassioned plea for a better world.\n  ...more"

And let's not forget the esteem-sapping elements like dress codes, task forces, brainstorming, and engagement surveys; flip charts, org charts, hard stops, and hard-ons. Each chapter includes personal anecdotes, quotes from business experts, and the latest research to answer the burning question: If companies truly believe employees are their most valuable resource, why do they treat them like crap?\n\nIn Corporate Crap, readers will learn: \n - How companies are trying to shorten meetings by making everyone stand and other forms of torture.\n - Why the founder of Second City Works calls Tina Fey \"a genius boss.\" \n - How the author burned his first professional bridge in his first-ever exit interview.\n - Why 700 million vacation days went unused last year. (What is wrong with you people?) \n - The roots of \"at the end of the day\" and other common expressions.\n - Why companies don't call employees \"employees\" anymore - and how it can backfire on them.\n - How hiring managers are affected by stereotypes - and not always how you'd think.\n - Why companies' obsession with labeling employees as introverts or extroverts is a complete waste of time.\n - The biggest problem companies have firing people.\n - Why the idea that \"no idea is a bad idea\" is a bad idea.\n - What people really do during conference calls.\n\nThere are lessons to be learned here: lessons that will entertain and inform anyone who has ever worked for a large corporation. Lessons learned from 40 years of Corporate Crap!\n\nHoward Harrison draws from four decades of corporate experience. After earning a journalism degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1978, he joined the corporate headquarters of Walgreen Company. In 1980, he was a writer/editor for the Hospital Financial Management Association; he was then hired by Alexander Grant & Company to lead communications for the newly formed Grant Thornton International. In 1982-83, Harrison worked as an editor-at-large for the American Bar Association Press. Late in 1983, he joined Baxter International, creating a new employee magazine that won the Gold Quill Award of Excellence from the International Association of Business Communicators in 1991. Today he provides writing and editorial services through his company Harrison Editorial Inc. and is the author of two previous books: NOW They Make it Legal: Reflections of an Aging Baby Boomer, a 2016 Reviewer's Choice by Midwest Book Review, and The Great Divide: Story of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Race.\n  ...more"

It's a \"Brotopia,\" where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties.\n\nIn this powerful exposé, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don't Be Evil! Connect the World!)--and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back.\n\nDrawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao's high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they \"won't lower their standards\" just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer--who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman--reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women.\n\nSilicon Valley's aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. It's time to break up the boys' club. Emily Chang shows us how to fix this toxic culture--to bring down Brotopia, once and for all.\n  ...more"

He constructed a fleet of customized unicycles and a flamethrowing trumpet, outfoxed Vegas casinos, and built juggling robots. He also wrote the seminal text of the digital revolution, which has been called “the Magna Carta of the Information Age.” His discoveries would lead contemporaries to compare him to Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton. His work anticipated by decades the world we’d be living in today—and gave mathematicians and engineers the tools to bring that world to pass.\n\nIn this elegantly written, exhaustively researched biography, Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman reveal Claude Shannon’s full story for the first time. It’s the story of a small-town Michigan boy whose career stretched from the era of room-sized computers powered by gears and string to the age of Apple. It’s the story of the origins of our digital world in the tunnels of MIT and the “idea factory” of Bell Labs, in the “scientists’ war” with Nazi Germany, and in the work of Shannon’s collaborators and rivals, thinkers like Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Vannevar Bush, and Norbert Wiener.\n\nAnd it’s the story of Shannon’s life as an often reclusive, always playful genius. With access to Shannon’s family and friends, A Mind at Play brings this singular innovator and creative genius to life.\n  ...more"

Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?\n\nThe shocking answer is: None of the above!\n\nIn his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint.\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.\n\nSecrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.\n\nIn Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"Wealth Files,\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.\n\nIf you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint. Unfortunately your current money blueprint will tend to stay with you for the rest of your life, unless you identify and revise it, and that's exactly what you will do with the help of this extraordinary book. According to T. Harv Eker, it's simple. If you think like rich people think and do what rich people do, chances are you'll get rich too!\n  ...more"

It says that the marketer is not--and ought not to be--at the center of successful marketing. The customer should be. Are you ready for that?\" --From the Foreword by Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point. \n\nCounter to traditional marketing wisdom, which tries to count, measure, and manipulate the spread of information, Seth Godin argues that the information can spread most effectively from customer to customer, rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to-customer dialogue the ideavirus, and cheerfully eggs marketers on to create an environment where their ideas can replicate and spread. \n\nIn lively detail, Godin looks at the ways companies such as PayPal, Hotmail, GeoCities, even Volkswagen have successfully launched ideaviruses. He offers a \"recipe\" for creating your own ideavirus, identifies the key factors in the successful spread of an ideavirus (powerful sneezers, hives, a clear vector, a smooth, friction-free transmission), and shows how any business, large or small, can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that just doesn't want to hear it anymore from the traditional marketers.\n  ...more"

Millions of workers, even those who have carefully chosen careers based on true passions and interests, dread going to work, suffering each day as they trudge to jobs that make them cynical, weary, and frustrated. It is a simple fact of business life that any job, from investment banker to dishwasher, can become miserable. Through the story of a CEO turned pizzeria manager, Lencioni reveals the three elements that make work miserable -- irrelevance, immeasurability, and anonymity -- and gives managers and their employees the keys to make any job more fulfilling.\n\nAs with all of Lencioni's books, this one is filled with actionable advice you can put into effect immediately. In addition to the fable, the book includes a detailed model examining the three signs of job misery and how they can be remedied. It covers the benefits of managing for job fulfillment within organizations -- increased productivity, greater retention, and competitive advantage -- and offers examples of how managers can use the applications in the book to deal with specific jobs and situations.\n\nPatrick Lencioni (San Francisco, CA) is President of The Table Group, a management consulting firm specializing in executive team development and organizational health. As a consultant and keynote speaker, he has worked with thousands of senior executives and executive teams in organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies to high-tech startups to universities and nonprofits. His clients include AT&T, Bechtel, Boeing, Cisco, Sam's Club, Microsoft, Mitsubishi, Allstate, Visa, FedEx, New York Life, Sprint, Novell, Sybase, The Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Lencioni is the author of six bestselling books, including The Five Dysfunctions of a Team. He previously worked for Oracle, Sybase, and the management consulting firm Bain & Company.\n  ...more"

By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is – good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky.\n\nFreakonomics has been imitated many times over – but only now, with SuperFreakonomics, has it met its match.\n  ...more"

How can a mathematical formula find your future spouse? Would you know if a statistical analysis blackballed you from a job you wanted?Today, number crunching affects your life in ways you might never imagine. In this lively and groundbreaking new book, economist Ian Ayres shows how today's best and brightest organizations are analyzing massive databases at lightening speed to provide greater insights into human behavior. They are the Super Crunchers. From internet sites like Google and Amazon that know your tastes better than you do, to a physician's diagnosis and your child's education, to boardrooms and government agencies, this new breed of decision makers are calling the shots. And they are delivering staggeringly accurate results. How can a football coach evaluate a player without ever seeing him play? Want to know whether the price of an airline ticket will go up or down before you buy? How can a formula outpredict wine experts in determining the best vintages? Super crunchers have the answers. In this brave new world of equation versus expertise, Ayres shows us the benefits and risks, who loses and who wins, and how super crunching can be used to help, not manipulate us.Gone are the days of solely relying on intuition to make decisions. No businessperson, consumer, or student who wants to stay ahead of the curve should make another keystroke without reading Super Crunchers.\n  ...more"

Now, in THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP, Jocko and Leif dive even deeper into the unchartered and complex waters of a concept first introduced in Extreme Ownership: finding balance between the opposing forces that pull every leader in different directions. Here, Willink and Babin get granular into the nuances that every successful leader must navigate. \n\nMastering the Dichotomy of Leadership requires understanding when to lead and when to follow; when to aggressively maneuver and when to pause and let things develop; when to detach and let the team run and when to dive into the details and micromanage. In addition, every leader must:\n· Take Extreme Ownership of everything that impacts their mission, yet utilize Decentralize Command by giving ownership to their team. \n· Care deeply about their people and their individual success and livelihoods, yet look out for the good of the overall team and above all accomplish the strategic mission. \n· Exhibit the most important quality in a leader—humility, but also be willing to speak up and push back against questionable decisions that could hurt the team and the mission.\n\nWith examples from the authors’ combat and training experiences in the SEAL teams, and then a demonstration of how each lesson applies to the business world, Willink and Babin clearly explain THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP—skills that are mission-critical for any leader and any team to achieve their ultimate goal: VICTORY.\n  ...more"

It needs to be heard by those you were called to lift out of dark places. You have honored that mandate thus far by writing a book and I have written this book to encourage you to honor it more fully by learning what it takes to sell 1,000 books in 21 days.\n\nMost authors I speak to have a message that's nearly bursting forth. They can't help but share it, their passion won't let them do anything but. The problem is that putting your message into words alone will never change lives. Once the message is packaged, it needs to be delivered (marketed) or the change you seek for those who struggle will never come to pass.\n\nI wrote this book to give order to the many ideas shared with me at The Author's Catapult 2014 Book Marketing Summit. There I interviewed 29 book marketing experts, bestselling authors and savvy digital marketers. They've collectively helped to sell MILLIONS and MILLIONS of books and I asked them \"How would you sell 1,000 books in 21 days?\"\n\nAs I reviewed each of the interviews multiple times I noticed patterns emerging. A thread ran through the interviews and it was all about relationships. These experts talked about relationships with partners, with prospects, with clients, with self and with money. It was quite wonderful how everything organized itself before my eyes.\n\nI was hoping they would shed more light for me on how to have a successful book launch. I had done that before with a few clients and was excited to sponge up even more insider info! Instead, the bulk of the conversations centered in how to develop relationships pre-book launch that would essentially create your own distribution network.\n\nSo Selling Well is about building an author platform and the systems to support it and to make it thrive. Because launching or relaunching a book is critical to the process of selling 1,000 books in 21 days, I included a bonus chapter the book about it and if you're interested in that you can download the chapter along with my entire Book Launch Starter Kit.\n\nLearning to market your book can be like climbing Mt. Everest, but you never have to do it alone, nor do I believe you should. With the proper gear, guidance & group, you can make it to the top of that peak and stand in a place to be heard by many more people. With help, you can be a powerful change-maker! \n\nIt is my intention as a book marketing coach to help you, if you so desire, create the structure -- the \"platform\" -- to be able to sell 1,000 books in 21 days. The principles & strategies shared in this book are powerful. They've been used by people like Jack Canfield & Mark Victor Hansen who have sold over ½ billion Chicken Soup for the Soul books. They've been used by 4-Hour Workweek author Timothy Ferriss. These principles are responsible for literally selling well over a billion books and I believe they will help you too! \n\nI’ve observed that the experts who have these five relationships down are the ones that are actually thriving. One can sell 1,000 books in 21 days without them in place, but only a 5 Relationship-focused expert can build on the momentum of a launch and turn it into an amazing business success. \n \nThe relationships start from within and move progressively outward. Incidentally, they are also the very tools that Sarah used to help her have an amazing book launch. \n \nWithout further ado, here are The 5 Relationships: \n \nRelationship 1: Your Mindset \nRelationship 2: Your Message \nRelationship 3: Your Marketing \nRelationship 4: Your Members \nRelationship 5: Your Money \n \nIn the book there are questions to ask yourself as well as an action plan to help you put each relationship into motion in your business. \n \nRelationship 1: Your Mindset \nWhen very successful people were asked by Napoleon Hill near the turn of the century what got them their wealth, in one way or another they referred to their mental ability to create before creating physically in the real world. Building on timeless principles Your Mindset is about creating that working relationship with yourself that fosters growth, ability and confidence. Here we discuss the process of turning your dreams into reality. \n \nRelationship 2: Your Message \nConfidence that you have something that will better lives leads successful authors to get to know their audience in a deep meaningful way. The message you share stems from this awareness of your reader and creates something that truly resonates with them. If the sum of the first relationship is “know thyself,” the short of this one is “know your reader.” In relationship 2 we share hot tips for targeting your ideal reader. \n \nRelationship 3: Your Marketing \nWhile many experts have the first two relationships down, this is where some things start to break down. They know they want to get the word out and often they are trying so hard. They blog, they tweet, they tell people. But in the end it feels like an uphill battle. The relationship examined in Your Marketing is the one you have with partners, those who are speaking to your readers, those who already have built trust with the ones you want to speak to. This is a core part of my group success program and it’s a core part of a platform that thrives. Here we uncover the secrets to building a big audience fast. \n \nRelationship 4: Your Members \nI’m not sure if it’s baggage from the past that keeps many experts from making regular and clear invites...Fear of rejection or something similar? If so, I can relate. But I can testify how a plan to do invite readers to become members of your group will that also share how to set up a plan that both encourages new subscribers and keeps them fiercely loyal. \n \nRelationship 5: Your Money \nLikely if any one of the five relationships is missing, it’s this one. Money’s ability to come to you hinges on your ability to create the organization and systems that money likes. You see, money is just a trust that has in your ability to solve their problems. That trust increases exponentially when you assure your members that they’re safe with you. I divulge some of the basic systems that actually make money, increase average orders and do so without breaking your back.\n  ...more"

Throughout the course of Colored Money, we will discuss the difference between assets and liabilities. We will also discuss the different types of income and how they affect your financial freedom and your freedom of time. We will discuss alternatives to things that typically plaque lower income communities such as a lack of financial literacy and wasteful spending habits.It's time we break free from the challenges and circumstances that have been \"chained\" to our people and our families for generations by educating ourselves, our children, and our communities about money, wealth, and freedom.

Even as technology exerts new pressures to speed up our lives, it turns out that the choices we make--unconsciously and consciously, in time frames varying from milliseconds to years--benefit profoundly from delay. As this winning and provocative book reveals, taking control of time and slowing down our responses yields better results in almost every arena of life ... even when time seems to be of the essence.\n\nThe procrastinator in all of us will delight in Partnoy's accounts of celebrity \"delay specialists,\" from Warren Buffett to Chris Evert to Steve Kroft, underscoring the myriad ways in which delaying our reactions to everyday choices--large and small--can improve the quality of our lives.\n  ...more"

In every sector global recession means continued pressure to reduce costs and increase productivity. All organisations are now driven to shine a spotlight closely at the contribution from every manager. A brilliant track record is no longer any guarantee of future job security. What matters is how much value you are adding now. \n\nSo how do we really do more with less? There are plenty of books with tips on how to manage your time - but although time management is likely to be part of the solution, it will not be enough on its own. The answer is to take control of your own productivity and lead by example, drawing on practical experience and develop innovative approaches that will really make a difference.\nKeynote speaker and productivity specialist Neen James says, “In today’s hectic workplace, it’s not just time management that you have to master, it’s super-productivity that gets the results. The secrets of super-productivity are not about working more; they’re about focusing your time, effort and energy on the things that will deliver the best results for you. It doesn’t mean ‘work longer’, ‘invest more money’, ‘create more lists or put your lists in a certain order’. It means: do less of the things that have no significance and more of the things that create an impact.”\n\nYou may be a top executive in an international corporation or responsible only for yourself.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. \n\nIn Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture.
